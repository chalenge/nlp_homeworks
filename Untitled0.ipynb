There is no master mind that\\r\\nwe can less afford to be ignorant of. To know more of the doings of\\r\\nPericles and Aspasia, of the two Caesars and the Serpent of old Nile,\\r\\nof Mary Stuart and Rizzio, of the Green Faction and the Blue, of\\r\\nOrsini and Colonna, than of the Bonapartes and Beauharnais, is worthy\\r\\nof a student of folklore rather than of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon was not only a King of Kings, he was a King of Words and of\\r\\nFacts, which \"are the sons of heaven, while words are the daughters of\\r\\nearth,\" and whose progeny, the Genii of the Code, still dominates\\r\\nChristendom.[1] In the hurly-burly of the French War, on the chilling\\r\\nmorrow of its balance-sheet, in the Janus alliance of the Second\\r\\nEmpire, we could not get rid of the nightmare of the Great Shadow.\\r\\nMost modern works on the Napoleonic period (Lord Rosebery\\'s \"Last\\r\\nPhase\" being a brilliant exception) seem to be (1) too long, (2) too\\r\\nlittle confined to contemporary sources. The first fault, especially\\r\\nif merely discursive enthusiasm, is excusable, the latter pernicious,\\r\\nfor, as Dr. Johnson says of Robertson, \"You are sure he does not know\\r\\nthe people whom he paints, so you cannot suppose a likeness.\\r\\nCharacters should never be given by a historian unless he knew the\\r\\npeople whom he describes, _or copies from those who knew him_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if ever, we must _fix_ and _crystallise_ the life-work of\\r\\nNapoleon for posterity, for \"when an opinion has once become popular,\\r\\nvery few are willing to oppose it. Idleness is more willing to credit\\r\\nthan inquire ... and he that writes merely for sale is tempted to\\r\\ncourt purchasers by flattering the prejudices of the public.\"[2] We\\r\\nhave accumulated practically all the evidence, and are not yet so\\r\\nremote from the aspirations and springs of action of a century ago as\\r\\nto be out of touch with them. The Vaccination and Education questions\\r\\nare still before us; so is the cure of croup and the composition of\\r\\nelectricity. We have special reasons for sympathy with the first\\r\\nfailures of Fulton, and can appreciate Napoleon\\'s primitive but\\r\\neffective expedients for modern telegraphy and transport, which were\\r\\nas far in advance of his era as his nephew\\'s ignorance of railway\\r\\nwarfare in 1870 was behind it. We must admire The Man[3] who found\\r\\nwithin the fields of France the command of the Tropics, and who needed\\r\\nnothing but time to prosper Corsican cotton and Solingen steel. The\\r\\nman\\'s words and deeds are still vigorous and alive; in another\\r\\ngeneration many of them will be dead as Marley--\"dead as a door-nail.\"\\r\\nLet us then each to his task, and each try, as best he may, to weigh\\r\\nin honest scales the modern Hannibal--\"our last great man,\"[4] \"the\\r\\nmightiest genius of two thousand years.\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n  H.

He\\r\\nhad always a terse, concise mode of speaking, and this, with the\\r\\nconstant habit of dictating, became accentuated. Whenever he could\\r\\nuse a short, compact word he did so. The greatest temptation has\\r\\nbeen to render his very modern ideas by modern colloquialisms.\\r\\nOccasionally, where Murray\\'s Dictionary proves that the word was\\r\\nin vogue a century ago, we have used a somewhat rarer word than\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s equivalent, as _e.g._ \"coolth,\" in Letter No. 6, Series\\r\\nB (_pendant le frais_), in order to preserve as far as possible the\\r\\nbrevity and crispness of the original. Napoleon\\'s vocabulary was not\\r\\nspecially wide, but always exact. In expletive it was extensive\\r\\nand peculiar. Judging his brother by himself, he did not consider\\r\\nLucien sufficient of a purist in French literature to write epics;\\r\\nand the same remark would have been partly true of the Emperor,\\r\\nwho, however, was always at considerable pains to verify any word\\r\\nof which he did not know the exact meaning.[6] His own appetite\\r\\nfor literature was enormous, especially during the year\\'s garrison\\r\\nlife he spent at Valence, where he read and re-read the contents of a\\r\\n_bouquiniste\\'s_ shop, and, what is more, remembered them, so much so\\r\\nthat, nearly a quarter of a century later, he was able to correct the\\r\\ndates of ecclesiastical experts at Erfurt. Whatever he says or\\r\\nwhatever he writes, one always finds a specific gravity of stark,\\r\\nstaring facts altogether abnormal. For generations it was the fashion\\r\\nto consider \"as false as a bulletin\" peculiar to Napoleon\\'s\\r\\ndespatches; but the publication of Napoleon\\'s correspondence, by\\r\\norder of Napoleon III., has changed all that. In the first place,\\r\\nas to dates. Not only have Haydn, Woodward and Cates, and the\\r\\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_ made mistakes during this period, but\\r\\neven the _Biographie Universelle_ (usually so careful) is not\\r\\nimmaculate. Secondly, with regard to the descriptions of the battles.\\r\\nWe have never found one that in accuracy and truthfulness would\\r\\nnot compare to conspicuous advantage with some of those with which\\r\\nwe were only too familiar in December 1899. Napoleon was sometimes\\r\\n1200 miles away from home; he had to gauge the effect of his\\r\\nbulletins from one end to the other of the largest effective empire\\r\\nthat the world has ever seen, and, like Dr. Johnson in Fleet\\r\\nStreet reporting Parliamentary debates (but with a hundred times more\\r\\nreason), he was determined not to let the other dogs have the best of\\r\\nit. The notes on the battles of Eylau (Series H) and Essling (Series\\r\\nL), the two most conspicuous examples of where it was necessary to\\r\\ncolour the bulletins, will show what is meant. Carlyle was the first\\r\\nto point out that his despatches are as instinct with genius as his\\r\\nconquests--his very words have \"Austerlitz battles\" in them. The\\r\\nreference to \"General Danube,\" in 1809, as the best general the\\r\\nAustrians had, was one of those flashes of inspiration which\\r\\nmilitary writers, from Napoleon to Lord Wolseley, have shown to be\\r\\na determining factor in every doubtful fray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Approfondissez_--go to the bottom of things,\" wrote Lord Chesterfield;\\r\\nand this might have been the life-motto of the Emperor. But to adopt\\r\\nthis fundamental common-sense with regard to the character of Napoleon\\r\\nis almost impossible; it is, to use the metaphor of Lord Rosebery,\\r\\nlike trying to span a mountain with a tape. We can but indicate a few\\r\\nleading features. In the first place, he had, like the great\\r\\nStagirite, an eye at once telescopic and microscopic. Beyond the\\r\\n_mecanique celeste_, beyond the nebulous reign of chaos and old night,\\r\\nhis ken pierced the primal truth--the need of a Creator: \"not every\\r\\none can be an atheist who wishes it.\" No man saw deeper into the causes\\r\\nof things. The influence of sea power on history, to take one\\r\\nexample, was never absent from his thoughts. Slowly and laboriously he\\r\\nbuilt and rebuilt his fleets, only to fall into the hands of his \"Punic\"\\r\\nrival. Beaten at sea, he has but two weapons left against England--to\\r\\n\"conquer her by land,\" or to stir up a maritime rival who will sooner\\r\\nor later avenge him. We have the Emperor Alexander\\'s testimony from\\r\\nthe merchants of Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool how nearly his\\r\\nContinental System _had_ ruined us. The rival raised up beyond the\\r\\nwestern waves by the astute sale of Louisiana is still growing. In less\\r\\nthan a decade Napoleon had a first crumb of comfort (when such crumbs\\r\\nwere rare) in hearing of the victories of the _Constitution_ over\\r\\nBritish frigates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for his microscopic eye, we know of nothing like it in all history.\\r\\nIn focussing the facets, we seem to shadow out the main secret of his\\r\\nsuccess--his ceaseless survey of all sorts and conditions of\\r\\nknowledge. \"Never despise local information,\" he wrote Murat, who was\\r\\nat Naples, little anticipating the extremes of good and evil fortune\\r\\nwhich awaited him there. Another characteristic--one in which he\\r\\nsurpassed alike the theory of Macchiavelli and the practice of the\\r\\nMedici--was his use of _la bascule_, with himself as equilibrist or\\r\\naverage adjuster, as the only safe principle of government. Opinions\\r\\non the whole[7] lean to the idea that, up to the First Consulate,\\r\\nNapoleon was an active Freemason, at a time when politics were\\r\\npermitted, and when the Grand Orient, having initiated Voltaire almost\\r\\non his deathbed, and having been submerged by the Terror, was\\r\\nbeginning to show new life. In any case, we have in O\\'Meara the\\r\\nEmperor\\'s statement (and this is rather against the theory of Napoleon\\r\\nbeing more than his brother Joseph, a mere patron of the craft) that\\r\\nhe encouraged the brotherhood. Cambaceres had more Masonic degrees\\r\\nthan probably any man before or since, and no man was so long and so\\r\\nconsistently trusted by Napoleon, with one short and significant\\r\\nexception. Then there was the _gendarmerie d\\'elite_, then the ordinary\\r\\npolice, the myrmidons of Fouche of Nantes--in fact, if we take Lord\\r\\nRosebery literally, Napoleon had \"half-a-dozen police agencies of his\\r\\nown.\" There was also Talleyrand and, during the Concordats, the whole\\r\\npriest-craft of Christendom as enlisting sergeants and spies\\r\\nextraordinary for the Emperor. Finally, when he wishes to attack\\r\\nRussia, he convokes a Sanhedrim at Paris, and wins the active\\r\\nsympathies of Israel. \"He was his own War Office, his own Foreign\\r\\nOffice, his own Admiralty.\"[8] His weak spot was his neglect of woman\\r\\nas a political factor; this department he left to Josephine, who was a\\r\\nfailure. She gained popularity, but no converts. The Faubourg St.\\r\\nGermain mistrusted a woman whose chief friend was the wife of\\r\\nThermidorian Tallien--Notre Dame de Septembre. In vain Napoleon raged\\r\\nand stormed about the Tallien friendship, till his final mandate in\\r\\n1806; and then it was too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother characteristic, very marked in these Home Letters, is the\\r\\ndesire not to give his wife anxiety. His ailments and his difficulties\\r\\nare always minimised.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps no man ever worked so hard physically and mentally as Napoleon\\r\\nfrom 1796 to 1814. Lord Rosebery reminds us that \"he would post from\\r\\nPoland to Paris, summon a council at once, and preside over it with\\r\\nhis usual vigour and acuteness.\" And his councils were no joke; they\\r\\nwould last eight or ten hours. Once, at two o\\'clock in the morning,\\r\\nthe councillors were all worn-out; the Minister of Marine was fast\\r\\nasleep. Napoleon still urged them to further deliberation: \"Come,\\r\\ngentlemen, pull yourselves together; it is only two o\\'clock, we must\\r\\nearn the money that the nation gives us.\" The Commission who first\\r\\nsifted the _Correspondence_ may well speak of the ceaseless workings\\r\\nof that mind, which _knew no rest save change of occupation_, and of\\r\\n\"that universal intelligence from which nothing escaped.\" The chief\\r\\nfault in Napoleon as a statesman was intrinsically a virtue, viz., his\\r\\ngood nature. There was, as Sir Walter Scott has said, \"gentleness and\\r\\neven softness in his character. It was his common and expressive\\r\\nphrase that the heart of a politician should be in his head; but his\\r\\nfeelings sometimes surprised him in a gentler mood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be a relation of his own or his wife\\'s, to have been a friend in\\r\\nhis time of stress, was to have a claim on Napoleon\\'s support which no\\r\\nsubsequent treachery to himself could efface. From the days of his new\\r\\npower--political power, first the Consulate and then the Empire--he\\r\\nlavished gifts and favours even on the most undeserving of his early\\r\\ncomrades. Fouche, Talleyrand, Bernadotte were forgiven once, twice,\\r\\nand again, to his own final ruin. Like Medea, one of whose other\\r\\nexploits he had evoked in a bulletin, he could say--but to his honour\\r\\nand not to his shame--\\r\\n\\r\\n          \"Si possem, sanior essem.\\r\\n  Sed trahit invitam nova vis; aliudque Cupido,\\r\\n  Mens aliud suadet. Video meliora, proboque\\r\\n  Deteriora sequor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTreachery and peculation against the State was different, as Moreau,\\r\\nBourrienne, and even Massena and Murat discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for his family, they were a flabby and somewhat sensual lot, with\\r\\nthe exception of Lucien, who was sufficiently capable to be hopelessly\\r\\nimpracticable. He was, however, infinitely more competent than the\\r\\neffeminate Joseph and the melancholy Louis, and seems to have had more\\r\\ncommand of parliamentary oratory than Napoleon himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s influence on literary men may be gauged by what Wieland[9]\\r\\nand Mueller[10] reported of their interview with him at Erfurt. That\\r\\nwith Wieland took place at the ball which followed the entertainment\\r\\non the field of Jena. \"I was presented,\" he says, \"by the Duchess of\\r\\nWeimar, with the usual ceremonies; he then paid me some compliments in\\r\\nan affable tone, and looked steadfastly at me. Few men have\\r\\nappeared to me to possess, in the same degree, the art of reading\\r\\nat the first glance the thoughts of other men. He saw, in an\\r\\ninstant, that notwithstanding my celebrity I was simple in my manners\\r\\nand void of pretension; and, as he seemed desirous of making a\\r\\nfavourable impression on me, he assumed the tone most likely to\\r\\nattain his end. I have never beheld any one more calm, more simple,\\r\\nmore mild, or less ostentatious in appearance; nothing about him\\r\\nindicated the feeling of power in a great monarch; he spoke to me as\\r\\nan old acquaintance would speak to an equal; and what was more\\r\\nextraordinary on his part, he conversed with me exclusively for an\\r\\nhour and a half, to the great surprise of the whole assembly.\"\\r\\nWieland has related part of their conversation, which is, as it could\\r\\nnot fail to be, highly interesting. They touched on a variety of\\r\\nsubjects; among others, the ancients. Napoleon declared his\\r\\npreference of the Romans to the Greeks. \"The eternal squabbles of\\r\\ntheir petty republics,\" he said, \"were not calculated to give birth\\r\\nto anything grand; whereas the Romans were always occupied with great\\r\\nthings, and it was owing to this they raised up the Colossus which\\r\\nbestrode the world.\" This preference was characteristic; the\\r\\nfollowing is anomalous: \"He preferred Ossian to Homer.\" \"He was fond\\r\\nonly of serious poetry,\" continues Wieland; \"the pathetic and\\r\\nvigorous writers; and, above all, the tragic poets. He appeared to\\r\\nhave no relish for anything gay; and in spite of the prepossessing\\r\\namenity of his manners, an observation struck me often, he seemed to\\r\\nbe of bronze. Nevertheless, he had put me so much at my ease that I\\r\\nventured to ask how it was that the public worship he had restored\\r\\nin France was not more philosophical and in harmony with the\\r\\nspirit of the times? \\'My dear Wieland,\\' he replied, \\'religion is not\\r\\nmeant for philosophers; they have no faith either in me or my\\r\\npriests. As to those who do believe, it would be difficult to give\\r\\nthem or to leave them too much of the marvellous. If I had to\\r\\nframe a religion for philosophers, it would be just the reverse of\\r\\nthat of the credulous part of mankind.\\'\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMueller, the celebrated Swiss historian, who had a private interview\\r\\nwith Napoleon at this period, has left a still fuller account of the\\r\\nimpression he received. \"The Emperor[12] began to speak,\" says Mueller,\\r\\n\"of the history of Switzerland, told me that I ought to complete it,\\r\\nthat even the more recent times had their interest. He proceeded from\\r\\nthe Swiss to the old Greek constitutions and history; to the theory of\\r\\nconstitutions; to the complete diversity of those of Asia, and the\\r\\ncauses of this diversity in the climate, polygamy, &c.; the opposite\\r\\ncharacters of the Arabian and the Tartar races; the peculiar value of\\r\\nEuropean culture, and the progress of freedom since the sixteenth\\r\\ncentury; how everything was linked together, and in the inscrutable\\r\\nguidance of an invisible hand; how he himself had become great through\\r\\nhis enemies; the great confederation of nations, the idea of which\\r\\nHenry IV. had; the foundation of all religion, and its necessity; that\\r\\nman could not bear clear truth, and required to be kept in order;\\r\\nadmitting the possibility, however, of a more happy condition if the\\r\\nnumerous feuds ceased, which were occasioned by too complicated\\r\\nconstitutions (such as the German), and the intolerable burden\\r\\nsuffered by states from excessive armies.\" These opinions clearly mark\\r\\nthe guiding motives of Napoleon\\'s attempts to enforce upon different\\r\\nnations uniformity of institutions and customs. \"I opposed him\\r\\noccasionally,\" says Mueller, \"and he entered into discussion. Quite\\r\\nimpartially and truly, as before God, I must say that the variety of\\r\\nhis knowledge, the acuteness of his observations, the solidity of his\\r\\nunderstanding (not dazzling wit), his grand and comprehensive views,\\r\\nfilled me with astonishment, and his manner of speaking to me, with\\r\\nlove for him. By his genius and his disinterested goodness, he has\\r\\nalso conquered me.\" Slowly but surely they are conquering the world.\\r\\nOf his goodness we have the well-weighed verdict of Lord Acton, that\\r\\nit was \"the most splendid that has appeared on earth.\" Of his\\r\\ngoodness, we may at least concur in the opinion of the old British tar\\r\\nat Elba, quoted by Sir Walter, and evidently his own view, that \"Boney\\r\\nwas a d--d good fellow after all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the character of _Josephine_ opinions still differ\\r\\nabout every quality but one. Like the friend of Goldsmith\\'s mad dog--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"A kind and gentle heart she had\\r\\n    To comfort friends and foes:\"\\r\\n\\r\\neither her brother Mason Cambaceres, or her brother Catholic and\\r\\nunbrotherly brother-in-law Lucien.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom early days she had learnt \"how to flirt and how to fib.\" Morality\\r\\nwas at a low ebb during the French Revolution, when women often saved\\r\\ntheir necks at the expense of their bodies, and there is unfortunately\\r\\nno doubt that Josephine was no exception. It is certain, however, from\\r\\nhis first letters to Josephine, that Napoleon knew nothing of this at\\r\\nthe time of his honeymoon (solus) in Italy. Gradually, but very\\r\\nunwillingly, his eyes were opened, and by the time he had reached\\r\\nEgypt he felt himself absolved from the absolute faithfulness he had\\r\\nhitherto preserved towards his wife. On his return Josephine becomes\\r\\nonce more his consort, and even his friend--never again his only love.\\r\\nJosephine\\'s main characteristic henceforward is to make everybody\\r\\nhappy and comfortable--in spite of Napoleon\\'s grumblings at her\\r\\nreckless prodigality; never to say No! (except to her husband\\'s\\r\\naccusations) suits her Creole disposition best, especially as it costs\\r\\nher no active exertion, and the Emperor pays for all. And so, having\\r\\nbeen in turn Our Lady of Victories and Saint Mary the Egyptian, she\\r\\nbecomes from her coronation to her death-day \"The Mother of the\\r\\nPoor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SOURCES OF THE LETTERS.--These may be divided into three\\r\\nparts--(1st) the Early Love-Letters of 1796; (2nd) the Collection\\r\\npublished by Didot Freres in 1833; and (3rd) the few scattered Letters\\r\\ngathered from various outside sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1st) With regard to the Early Love-Letters of 1796, these are found\\r\\nmost complete in a work published by Longmans in 1824, in two volumes,\\r\\nwith the title, \"A Tour through Parts of the Netherlands, Holland,\\r\\nGermany, Switzerland, Savoy, and France, in the year 1821-2, by\\r\\nCharles Tennant, Esq.; also containing in an Appendix Fac-simile\\r\\nCopies of Eight Letters in the handwriting of Napoleon Bonaparte to\\r\\nhis wife Josephine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author introduces them with an interesting preface, which shows\\r\\nthat then, as now, the interest in everything connected with Napoleon\\r\\nwas unabated:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Long after this fleeting book shall have passed away, and with its\\r\\nauthor shall have been forgotten, these documents will remain; for\\r\\nhere, perhaps, is to be found the purest source of information which\\r\\nexists, touching the private character of Napoleon Bonaparte, known,\\r\\nprobably, but to the few whose situations have enabled them to observe\\r\\nthat extraordinary man in the undisguised relations of domestic life.\\r\\nAlthough much already has been said and written of him, yet the\\r\\neagerness with which every little anecdote and incident of his life is\\r\\nsought for shows the interest which still attaches to his name, and\\r\\nthese, no doubt, will be bequests which posterity will duly estimate.\\r\\nFrom these it will be the province of future historians to cull and\\r\\nselect simple and authenticated facts, and from these only can be\\r\\ndrawn a true picture of the man whose fame has already extended into\\r\\nevery distant region of the habitable globe.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will now proceed to relate the means by which I am enabled to\\r\\nintroduce into this journal fac-simile copies of eight letters in the\\r\\nhandwriting of Napoleon Bonaparte, the originals of which are in my\\r\\npossession. Had these been of a political nature, much as I should\\r\\nprize any relics of such a man, yet they would not have appeared in a\\r\\nbook from which I have studiously excluded all controversial topics,\\r\\nand more especially those of a political character. Neither should I\\r\\nhave ventured upon their publication if there were a possibility that\\r\\nby so doing I might wound the feelings of any human being. Death has\\r\\nclosed the cares of the individuals connected with these letters. Like\\r\\nthe memorials of Alexander the Great or of Charlemagne, they are the\\r\\nproperty of the possessor, and through him of the public; but not like\\r\\nancient documents, dependent upon legendary evidence for their\\r\\nidentity and truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These have passed to me through two hands only, since they came into\\r\\npossession of the Empress Josephine, to whom they are written by\\r\\ntheir illustrious author. One of the individuals here alluded to, and\\r\\nfrom whom I received these letters, is a Polish nobleman, who attached\\r\\nhimself and his fortunes to Bonaparte, whose confidence he enjoyed in\\r\\nseveral important diplomatic negotiations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis book and these letters were known to Sir Walter Scott, who made\\r\\nuse of some of them in his _History of Napoleon_. M. Aubenas, in his\\r\\n_Histoire de l\\'Imperatrice Josephine_, published in 1857, which has\\r\\nbeen lavishly made use of in a recent work on the same subject, seems\\r\\nto have known, at any rate, four of these letters, which were\\r\\ncommunicated to him by M. le Baron Feuillet de Conches. Monsieur\\r\\nAubenas seems never to have seen the Tennant Collection, of which\\r\\nthese undoubtedly form part, but as Baron Feuillet de Conches was an\\r\\nexpert in deciphering Bonaparte\\'s extraordinary caligraphy, these\\r\\nletters are very useful for reference in helping us to translate some\\r\\nphrases which had been given up as illegible by Mr. Tennant and Sir\\r\\nWalter Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2nd) The _Collection Didot_. This enormously valuable collection\\r\\nforms by far the greater part of the Letters that we possess of\\r\\nNapoleon to his wife. They are undoubtedly authentic, and have\\r\\nbeen utilised largely by Aubenas, St. Amand, Masson, and the\\r\\n_Correspondance de Napoleon I._ They were edited by Madame Salvage\\r\\nde Faverolles. As is well known, Sir Walter Scott was very anxious to\\r\\nobtain possession of these letters for his _Life of Napoleon_, and\\r\\nhis visit to Paris was partly on this account. In _Archibald\\r\\nConstable and his Literary Correspondents_, edited in 1873 by his son,\\r\\nwe find the following:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Letter from_ ARCHIBALD CONSTABLE _to_ SIR WALTER SCOTT.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"_August 30, 1825._\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have had various conversations with Mr. Thomson on the subject of\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s correspondence with Josephine. Mr. Thomson communicated\\r\\nwith Count Flahault for me in the view of its being published, and\\r\\nwhether the letters could not, in the meantime, be rendered\\r\\naccessible. The publication, it seems, under any circumstances, is by\\r\\nno means determined on, but should they be given, the price expected\\r\\nis five thousand guineas, which I should imagine greatly too much. I\\r\\nhave an enumeration of the letters, from whence written, &c. I shall\\r\\nsubjoin a copy of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were finally published in 1833, they seem to have been\\r\\nstimulated into existence by publication of the _Memorial de\\r\\nSaint-Helene_, better known in England as _Las Cases_. Doubtless\\r\\nHortense only allowed such letters to be published as would not injure\\r\\nthe reputation of her mother or her relations. In the Preface it is\\r\\nstated: \"We think that these letters will afford an interest as\\r\\nimportant as delightful. Everything that comes from Napoleon, and\\r\\neverything that appertains to him, will always excite the lively\\r\\nattention of contemporaries and posterity. If the lofty meditation of\\r\\nphilosophy concerns itself only with the general influence of great\\r\\nmen upon their own generation and future ones, a curiosity of another\\r\\nnature, and not less greedy, loves to penetrate into the inmost\\r\\nrecesses of their soul, in order to elicit their most secret\\r\\ninclinations. It likes to learn what has been left of the _man_, amid\\r\\nthe preoccupations of their projects and the elevation of their\\r\\nfortune. It requires to know in what manner their character has\\r\\nmodified their genius, or has been subservient to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is this curiosity that we hope to satisfy by the publication of\\r\\nthese letters. They reveal the inmost thought of Napoleon, they will\\r\\nreflect his earliest impulses, they will show how the General, the\\r\\nConsul, and the Emperor felt and spoke, not in his discourses or his\\r\\nproclamations--the official garb of his thought--but in the free\\r\\noutpourings of the most passionate or the most tender affections....\\r\\nThis correspondence will prove, we strongly believe, that the\\r\\nconqueror was human, the master of the world a good husband, the great\\r\\nman in fact an excellent man.... We shall see in them how, up to the\\r\\nlast moment, he lavished on his wife proofs of his tenderness. Without\\r\\ndoubt the letters of the Emperor Napoleon are rarer and shorter than\\r\\nthose of the First Consul, and the First Consul writes no longer like\\r\\nGeneral Bonaparte, but everywhere the sentiment is fundamentally the\\r\\nsame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We make no reflection on the style of these letters, written in haste\\r\\nand in all the _abandon_ of intimacy. We can easily perceive they were\\r\\nnot destined to see the light. Nevertheless we publish them without\\r\\nchanging anything in them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Collection Didot_ contains 228 letters from Napoleon to\\r\\nJosephine, and 70 from Josephine to Hortense, and two from Josephine\\r\\nto Napoleon, which seem to be the only two in existence of Josephine\\r\\nto Napoleon whose authenticity is unquestioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3rd) The fugitive letters are collected from various sources, and\\r\\ntheir genuineness does not seem to be quite as well proved as those\\r\\nof the Tennant or Didot Series. We have generally taken the\\r\\n_Correspondence of Napoleon I._ as the touchstone of their merit to be\\r\\ninserted here, although one of them--that republished from _Las\\r\\nCases_ (No. 85, Series G.)--is manifestly mainly the work of that\\r\\nversatile author, who is utterly unreliable except when confirmed\\r\\nby others. As Lord Rosebery has well said, the book is \"an arsenal\\r\\nof spurious documents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have relegated to an Appendix those published by Madame Ducrest, as\\r\\ntransparent forgeries, and have to acknowledge with thanks a letter\\r\\nfrom M. Masson on this subject which thoroughly confirms these views.\\r\\nThere seems some reason to doubt No. I., Series E, but being in the\\r\\n_Correspondence_, I have translated it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Correspondence of Napoleon I._ is a splendid monument to the\\r\\nmemory of Napoleon. It is alluded to throughout the Notes as _The\\r\\nCorrespondence_, and it deserves special recognition here. Its\\r\\ncompilation was decreed by Napoleon III. from Boulogne, on 7th\\r\\nSeptember 1854, and the first volume appeared in 1858, and the last in\\r\\n1870. With the first volume is inserted the Report of the Commission\\r\\nto the Emperor, part of which we subjoin:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Report of the Commission to the Emperor._\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIRE,--Augustus numbered Caesar among the gods, and dedicated to him a\\r\\ntemple; the temple has disappeared, the Commentaries remain. Your\\r\\nMajesty, wishing to raise to the chief of your dynasty an imperishable\\r\\nmonument, has ordered us to gather together and publish the political,\\r\\nmilitary, and administrative correspondence of Napoleon I. It has\\r\\nrealised that the most conspicuous (_eclatant_) homage to render to\\r\\nthis incomparable genius was to make him known in his entirety. No one\\r\\nis ignorant of his victories, of the laws with which he has endowed\\r\\nour country, the institutions that he has founded and which dwell\\r\\nimmovable after so many revolutions; his prosperity and his reverses\\r\\nare in every mouth; history has recounted what he has done, but it has\\r\\nnot always known his designs: it has not had the secret of so many\\r\\nadmirable combinations that have been the spoil of fortune (_que la\\r\\nfortune a dejouees_), and so many grand projects for the execution of\\r\\nwhich time alone was wanting. The traces of Napoleon\\'s thoughts were\\r\\nscattered; it was necessary to reunite them and to give them to the\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such is the task which your Majesty confided to us, and of which we\\r\\nwere far from suspecting the extent. The thousands of letters which\\r\\nwere received from all parts have allowed us to follow, in spite of a\\r\\nfew regrettable _lacunae_, the thoughts of Napoleon day by day, and to\\r\\nassist, so to say, at the birth of his projects, at the ceaseless\\r\\nworkings of his mind, which knew no other rest than change of\\r\\noccupation. But what is perhaps most surprising in the reading of a\\r\\ncorrespondence so varied, is the power of that universal intelligence\\r\\nfrom which nothing escaped, which in turn raised itself without an\\r\\neffort to the most sublime conceptions, and which descends with the\\r\\nsame facility to the smallest details.... Nothing seems to him\\r\\nunworthy of his attention that has to do with the realisation of his\\r\\ndesigns; and it is not sufficient for him to give the most precise\\r\\norders, but he superintends himself the execution of them with an\\r\\nindefatigable perseverance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letters of Napoleon can add nothing to his glory, but they better\\r\\nenable us to comprehend his prodigious destiny, the prestige that he\\r\\nexercised over his contemporaries--\\'le culte universel dont sa memoire\\r\\nest l\\'objet, enfin, l\\'entrainement irresistible par lequel la France a\\r\\nreplace sa dynastie au sommet de l\\'edifice qu\\'il avait construit.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These letters also contain the most fruitful sources of information\\r\\n... for peoples as for governments; for soldiers and for statesmen no\\r\\nless than for historians. Perhaps some persons, greedy of knowing the\\r\\nleast details concerning the intimate life of great men, will regret\\r\\nthat we have not reproduced those letters which, published elsewhere\\r\\nfor the most part, have only dealt with family affairs and domestic\\r\\nrelations. Collected together by us as well as the others, they have\\r\\nnot found a place in the plan of which your Majesty has fixed for us\\r\\nthe limits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us haste to declare that, in conformity with the express\\r\\nintentions of your Majesty, we have scrupulously avoided, in the\\r\\nreproduction of the letters of the Emperor, any alteration,\\r\\ncurtailment, or modification of the text. Sometimes, thinking of the\\r\\nlegitimate sorrow which blame from so high a quarter may cause, we\\r\\nhave regretted not to be able to soften the vigorous judgment of\\r\\nNapoleon on many of his contemporaries, but it was not our province to\\r\\ndiscuss them, still less to explain them; but if, better informed or\\r\\ncalmer, the Emperor has rendered justice to those of his servants that\\r\\nhe had for a moment misunderstood, we have been glad to indicate that\\r\\nthese severe words have been followed by reparation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have found it necessary to have the spelling of names of places\\r\\nand of persons frequently altered, but we have allowed to remain\\r\\nslight incorrectnesses of language which denote the impetuosity of\\r\\ncomposition, and which often could not be rectified without weakening\\r\\nthe originality of an energetic style running right to its object,\\r\\nbrief and precise as the words of command. Some concise notes\\r\\nnecessary for clearing up obscure passages are the sole conditions\\r\\nwhich we have allowed ourselves....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Commission has decided in favour of chronological order\\r\\nthroughout. It is, moreover, the only one which can reproduce\\r\\nfaithfully the sequence of the Emperor\\'s thoughts. It is also the best\\r\\nfor putting in relief his universal aptitude and his marvellous\\r\\nfecundity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Napoleon wrote little with his own hand; nearly all the items of his\\r\\ncorrespondence were dictated to his secretaries, to his aides-de-camp\\r\\nand his chief of staff, or to his ministers. Thus the Commission has\\r\\nnot hesitated to comprise in this collection a great number of items\\r\\nwhich, although bearing another signature, evidently emanate from\\r\\nNapoleon....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By declaring that his public life dated from the siege of Toulon,\\r\\nNapoleon has himself determined the point of departure which the\\r\\nCommission should choose. It is from this immortal date that commences\\r\\nthe present publication.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"(Signed) THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"_Paris, January 20, 1858._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTEMPORARY SOURCES.--It is a commonplace that the history of\\r\\nNapoleon has yet to be written. His contemporaries were stunned or\\r\\noverwhelmed by the whirlwind of his glory; the next generation was\\r\\nblinded by meteoric fragments of his \"system,\" which glowed with\\r\\nimpotent heat as they fell through an alien atmosphere into oblivion.\\r\\nSuch were the Bourriennes, the Jominis, the Talleyrands, and other\\r\\ntraitors of that ilk. But\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"The tumult and the shouting dies;\\r\\n  The captains and the kings depart;\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand now, when all the lesser tumults and lesser men _have_ passed\\r\\naway, each new century will, as Lockhart foretold, \"inscribe one\\r\\nmighty era with the majestic name of Napoleon.\" And yet the writings\\r\\nof no contemporary can be ignored; neither Alison nor Scott, certainly\\r\\nnot Bignon, Montgaillard, Pelet, Mathieu Dumas, and Pasquier.\\r\\nConstant, Bausset, Meneval, Rovigo, and D\\'Abrantes are full of\\r\\ninterest for their personal details, and D\\'Avrillon, Las Cases,\\r\\nMarmont, Marbot, and Lejeune only a degree less so. Jung\\'s _Memoirs of\\r\\nLucien_ are invaluable, and those of Joseph and Louis Bonaparte\\r\\nuseful. But the _Correspondence_ is worth everything else, including\\r\\nPanckouke (1796-99), where, in spite of shocking arrangement, print,\\r\\nand paper, we get the replies as well as the letters. The _Biographie\\r\\nUniverselle Michaud_ is hostile, except the interesting footnotes of\\r\\nBegin. It must, however, be read. The article in the _Encyclopaedia\\r\\nBritannica_ was the work of an avowed enemy of the Napoleonic system,\\r\\nthe editor of the _Life and Times of Stein_.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Diary, the _Revue Chronologique de l\\'Histoire de France_ or\\r\\nMontgaillard (1823) has been heavily drawn upon, especially for the\\r\\nlater years, but wherever practicable the dates have been verified\\r\\nfrom the _Correspondence_ and bulletins of the day. On the whole, the\\r\\nrecords of respective losses in the battles are slightly favourable to\\r\\nthe French, as their figures have been usually taken; always, however,\\r\\nthe maximum French loss and the minimum of the allies is recorded,\\r\\nwhen unverified from other sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe late Professor Seeley, in his monograph, asserts that Napoleon,\\r\\ntried by his plan, is a failure--that even before death his words and\\r\\nactions merited no monument. We must seek, however, for the mightiest\\r\\nheritage of Napoleon in his brainchildren of the second generation,\\r\\nthe Genii of the Code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Code Napoleon claims to-day its two hundred million subjects. \"The\\r\\nLaw should be clean, precise, uniform; to interpret is to corrupt it.\"\\r\\nSo ruled the Emperor; and now, a century later, Archbishop Temple\\r\\n(born in one distant island the year Napoleon died in another) bears\\r\\ntestimony to the beneficent sway of Napoleon\\'s Word-Empire.\\r\\nCriticising English legal phraseology, the Archbishop of Canterbury\\r\\nsaid, \"The French Code is always welcome in every country where it has\\r\\nbeen introduced; and where people have once got hold of it, they are\\r\\nunwilling to have it changed for any other, because it is _a marvel of\\r\\nclearness_.\" Surely if ever Style _is_ the Man, it is Napoleon,\\r\\notherwise the inspection of over seven million words, as marshalled\\r\\nforth in his _Correspondence_, would not only confuse but confound. As\\r\\nit is, its \"hum of armies, gathering rank on rank,\" has left behind\\r\\nwhat Bacon calls a conflation of sound, from which, however, as from\\r\\nKipling\\'s steel-sinewed symphony,\\r\\n\\r\\n                  \"The clanging chorus goes--\\r\\n  Law, Order, Duty and Restraint, Obedience, Discipline.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n   [6] Sometimes he is perhaps more to be trusted than the leading\\r\\n       lexicographer, as for example when, the day after Wagram, he\\r\\n       writes his Minister of War that the _coup de Jarnac_ will come\\r\\n       from the English in Spain. Now, when the Jarnac in question was\\r\\n       slain in fair fight by La Chateignerie by a blow _au jarret_,\\r\\n       it was an _unexpected_ blow, but not surely, as Littre tells\\r\\n       us, _manoeuvre perfide_, _deloyale_. Nothing was too disloyal\\r\\n       for perfidious Albion, but for 30,000 English to outmanoeuvre\\r\\n       three marshals and 100,000 French veterans would be, and was,\\r\\n       the unexpected

Your portrait and the remembrance\\r\\nof last night\\'s delirium have robbed my senses of repose. Sweet and\\r\\nincomparable Josephine, what an extraordinary influence you have over\\r\\nmy heart. Are you vexed? do I see you sad? are you ill at ease? My\\r\\nsoul is broken with grief, and there is no rest for your lover. But is\\r\\nthere more for me when, delivering ourselves up to the deep feelings\\r\\nwhich master me, I breathe out upon your lips, upon your heart, a\\r\\nflame which burns me up--ah, it was this past night I realised that\\r\\nyour portrait was not you. You start at noon; I shall see you in three\\r\\nhours. Meanwhile, _mio dolce amor_, accept a thousand kisses,[14] but\\r\\ngive me none, for they fire my blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n  N.

You are the\\r\\nconstant object of my thoughts; I exhaust my imagination in thinking\\r\\nof what you are doing. If I see you unhappy, my heart is torn, and my\\r\\ngrief grows greater. If you are gay and lively among your friends\\r\\n(male and female), I reproach you with having so soon forgotten the\\r\\nsorrowful separation three days ago; thence you must be fickle, and\\r\\nhenceforward stirred by no deep emotions. So you see I am not easy to\\r\\nsatisfy; but, my dear, I have quite different sensations when I fear\\r\\nthat your health may be affected, or that you have cause to be\\r\\nannoyed; then I regret the haste with which I was separated from my\\r\\ndarling. I feel, in fact, that your natural kindness of heart exists\\r\\nno longer for me, and it is only when I am quite sure you are not\\r\\nvexed that I am satisfied. If I were asked how I slept, I feel that\\r\\nbefore replying I should have to get a message to tell me that you had\\r\\nhad a good night. The ailments, the passions of men influence me only\\r\\nwhen I imagine they may reach you, my dear. May my good genius, which\\r\\nhas always preserved me in the midst of great dangers, surround you,\\r\\nenfold you, while I will face my fate unguarded. Ah! be not gay, but a\\r\\ntrifle melancholy; and especially may your soul be free from worries,\\r\\nas your body from illness: you know what our good Ossian says on this\\r\\nsubject. Write me, dear, and at full length, and accept the thousand\\r\\nand one kisses of your most devoted and faithful friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n[This letter is translated from St. Amand\\'s _La Citoyenne Bonaparte_,\\r\\np. 3, 1892.]\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n  _March 27th.--Arrival at Nice and proclamation to the soldiers._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _April 3rd.--He is at Mentone._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Port Maurice, April 3rd._\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received all your letters, but none has affected me like the\\r\\nlast. How can you think, my charmer, of writing me in such terms? Do\\r\\nyou believe that my position is not already painful enough without\\r\\nfurther increasing my regrets and subverting my reason. What\\r\\neloquence, what feelings you portray; they are of fire, they inflame\\r\\nmy poor heart! My unique Josephine, away from you there is no more\\r\\njoy--away from thee the world is a wilderness, in which I stand alone,\\r\\nand without experiencing the bliss of unburdening my soul. You have\\r\\nrobbed me of more than my soul; you are the one only thought of my\\r\\nlife. When I am weary of the worries of my profession, when I mistrust\\r\\nthe issue, when men disgust me, when I am ready to curse my life, I\\r\\nput my hand on my heart where your portrait beats in unison. I look at\\r\\nit, and love is for me complete happiness; and everything laughs for\\r\\njoy, except the time during which I find myself absent from my\\r\\nbeloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy what art have you learnt how to captivate all my faculties, to\\r\\nconcentrate in yourself my spiritual existence--it is witchery, dear\\r\\nlove, which will end only with me. To live for Josephine, that is the\\r\\nhistory of my life. I am struggling to get near you, I am dying to be\\r\\nby your side; fool that I am, I fail to realise how far off I am, that\\r\\nlands and provinces separate us. What an age it will be before you\\r\\nread these lines, the weak expressions of the fevered soul in which\\r\\nyou reign. Ah, my winsome wife, I know not what fate awaits me, but if\\r\\nit keeps me much longer from you it will be unbearable--my strength\\r\\nwill not last out. There was a time in which I prided myself on my\\r\\nstrength, and, sometimes, when casting my eyes on the ills which men\\r\\nmight do me, on the fate that destiny might have in store for me, I\\r\\nhave gazed steadfastly on the most incredible misfortunes without a\\r\\nwrinkle on my brow or a vestige of surprise: but to-day the thought\\r\\nthat my Josephine might be ill; and, above all, the cruel, the fatal\\r\\nthought that she might love me less, blights my soul, stops my blood,\\r\\nmakes me wretched and dejected, without even leaving me the courage of\\r\\nfury and despair. I often used to say that men have no power over him\\r\\nwho dies without regrets; but, to-day, to die without your love, to\\r\\ndie in uncertainty of that, is the torment of hell, it is a lifelike\\r\\nand terrifying figure of absolute annihilation--I feel passion\\r\\nstrangling me. My unique companion! you whom Fate has destined to walk\\r\\nwith me the painful path of life! the day on which I no longer possess\\r\\nyour heart will be that on which parched Nature will be for me without\\r\\nwarmth and without vegetation. I stop, dear love! my soul is sad, my\\r\\nbody tired, my spirit dazed, men worry me--I ought indeed to detest\\r\\nthem; they keep me from my beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am at Port Maurice, near Oneille; to-morrow I shall be at Albenga.\\r\\nThe two armies are in motion. We are trying to deceive each\\r\\nother--victory to the most skilful! I am pretty well satisfied with\\r\\nBeaulieu; he need be a much stronger man than his predecessor to alarm\\r\\nme much. I expect to give him a good drubbing. Don\\'t be anxious; love\\r\\nme as thine eyes, but that is not enough; as thyself, more than\\r\\nthyself; as thy thoughts, thy mind, thy sight, thy all. Dear love,\\r\\nforgive me, I am exhausted; nature is weak for him who feels acutely,\\r\\nfor him whom you inspire.\\r\\n\\r\\n  N.

They have just brought me a letter. It\\r\\nis a sad one, my mind is distressed--it is the death of Chauvet. He\\r\\nwas _commissionaire ordinateur en chef_ of the army; you have\\r\\nsometimes seen him at the house of Barras. My love, I feel the need of\\r\\nconsolation. It is by writing to thee, to thee alone, the thought of\\r\\nwhom can so influence my moral being, to whom I must pour out my\\r\\ntroubles. What means the future? what means the past? what are we\\r\\nourselves? what magic fluid surrounds and hides from us the things\\r\\nthat it behoves us most to know? We are born, we live, we die in the\\r\\nmidst of marvels; is it astounding that priests, astrologers,\\r\\ncharlatans have profited by this propensity, by this strange\\r\\ncircumstance, to exploit our ideas, and direct them to their own\\r\\nadvantage. Chauvet is dead. He was attached to me. He has rendered\\r\\nessential service to the fatherland. His last words were that he was\\r\\nstarting to join me. Yes, I see his ghost; it hovers everywhere, it\\r\\nwhistles in the air. His soul is in the clouds, he will be propitious\\r\\nto my destiny. But, fool that I am, I shed tears for our friendship,\\r\\nand who shall tell me that I have not already to bewail the\\r\\nirreparable. Soul of my life, write me by every courier, else I shall\\r\\nnot know how to exist. I am very busy here. Beaulieu is moving his\\r\\narmy again. We are face to face. I am rather tired; I am every day on\\r\\nhorseback. Adieu, adieu, adieu; I am going to dream of you. Sleep\\r\\nconsoles me; it places you by my side, I clasp you in my arms. But on\\r\\nwaking, alas! I find myself three hundred leagues from you.\\r\\nRemembrances to Barras, Tallien, and his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n  N.

Ah, my dear, it is true I am wrong. In the spring the country\\r\\nis beautiful, and then the lover of nineteen will doubtless find means\\r\\nto spare an extra moment to write to him who, distant three hundred\\r\\nleagues from thee, lives, enjoys, exists only in thoughts of thee, who\\r\\nreads thy letters as one devours, after six hours\\' hunting, the meat\\r\\nhe likes best. I am not satisfied with your last letter; it is cold as\\r\\nfriendship. I have not found that fire which kindles your looks, and\\r\\nwhich I have sometimes fancied I found there. But how infatuated I am.\\r\\nI found your previous letters weigh too heavily on my mind. The\\r\\nrevolution which they produced there invaded my rest, and took my\\r\\nfaculties captive. I desired more frigid letters, but they gave me the\\r\\nchill of death. Not to be loved by Josephine, the thought of finding\\r\\nher inconstant ... but I am forging troubles--there are so many real\\r\\nones, there is no need to manufacture more! You cannot have inspired a\\r\\nboundless love without sharing it, for a cultured mind and a soul like\\r\\nyours cannot requite complete surrender and devotion with the\\r\\ndeath-blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received the letter from Madame Chateau Renard. I have written\\r\\nto the Minister. I will write to the former to-morrow, to whom you\\r\\nwill make the usual compliments. Kind regards to Madame Tallien and\\r\\nBarras.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou do not speak of your wretched indigestion--I hate it. Adieu, till\\r\\nto-morrow, _mio dolce amor_. A remembrance from my unique wife, and a\\r\\nvictory from Destiny--these are my wishes: a unique remembrance\\r\\nentirely worthy of him who thinks of thee every moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother is here; he has learnt of my marriage with pleasure. He\\r\\nlongs to see you. I am trying to prevail on him to go to Paris--his\\r\\nwife has just borne him a girl. He sends you a gift of a box of Genoa\\r\\nbonbons.

I have for\\r\\nhim the most lively affection. I trust he will obtain yours; he merits\\r\\nit. Nature has endowed him with a gentle, even, and unalterably good\\r\\ndisposition; he is made up of good qualities. I am writing Barras to\\r\\nhelp him to the Consulate of some Italian port. He wishes to live with\\r\\nhis little wife far from the great whirlwind, and from great events. I\\r\\nrecommend him to you. I have received your letters of (April) the\\r\\nfifth and tenth. You have been several days without writing me. What\\r\\n_are_ you doing then? Yes, my kind, kind love, I am not jealous, but\\r\\nsometimes uneasy. Come soon. I warn you, if you tarry you will find me\\r\\nill; fatigue and your absence are too much for me at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letters make up my daily pleasure, and my happy days are not\\r\\noften.

Be ready, if that is not disagreeable to you.\\r\\nShould he not come, woe without remedy; should he come back to me\\r\\nalone, grief without consolation, constant anxiety. My Beloved, he\\r\\nwill see you, he will breathe on your temples; perhaps you will accord\\r\\nhim the unique and priceless favour of kissing your cheek, and I, I\\r\\nshall be alone and very far away; but you are about to come, are you\\r\\nnot? You will soon be beside me, on my breast, in my arms, over your\\r\\nmouth. Take wings, come quickly, but travel gently. The route is long,\\r\\nbad, fatiguing. If you should be overturned or be taken ill, if\\r\\nfatigue--go gently, my beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received a letter from Hortense. She is entirely lovable. I am\\r\\ngoing to write to her.

A presentiment of ill oppresses me.\\r\\nI see you no longer. I have lost more than life, more than happiness,\\r\\nmore than my rest. I am almost without hope. I hasten to send a\\r\\ncourier to you. He will stay only four hours in Paris, and then\\r\\nbring me your reply. Write me ten pages. That alone can console me a\\r\\nlittle. You are ill, you love me, I have made you unhappy, you are in\\r\\ndelicate health, and I do not see you!--that thought overwhelms me. I\\r\\nhave done you so much wrong that I know not how to atone for it; I\\r\\naccuse you of staying in Paris, and you were ill there. Forgive me,\\r\\nmy dear; the love with which you have inspired me has bereft me of\\r\\nreason. I shall never find it again. It is an ill for which there\\r\\nis no cure. My presentiments are so ominous that I would confine\\r\\nmyself to merely seeing you, to pressing you for two hours to my\\r\\nheart--and then dying with you. Who looks after you? I expect you\\r\\nhave sent for Hortense. I love that sweet child a thousand times more\\r\\nwhen I think she can console you a little, though for me there is\\r\\nneither consolation nor repose, nor hope until the courier that I\\r\\nhave sent comes back; and until, in a long letter, you explain to me\\r\\nwhat is the nature of your illness, and to what extent it is\\r\\nserious; if it be dangerous, I warn you, I start at once for\\r\\nParis. My coming shall coincide with your illness. I have always\\r\\nbeen fortunate, never has my destiny resisted my will, and to-day I\\r\\nam hurt in what touches me solely (_uniquement_). Josephine, how\\r\\ncan you remain so long without writing to me; your last laconic\\r\\nletter is dated May 22. Moreover, it is a distressing one for me, but\\r\\nI always keep it in my pocket; your portrait and letters are\\r\\nperpetually before my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am nothing without you. I scarcely imagine how I existed without\\r\\nknowing you. Ah! Josephine, had you known my heart would you have\\r\\nwaited from May 18th to June 4th before starting? Would you have given\\r\\nan ear to perfidious friends who are perhaps desirous of keeping you\\r\\naway from me? I openly avow it to every one, I hate everybody who is\\r\\nnear you. I expected you to set out on May 24th, and arrive on June\\r\\n3rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine, if you love me, if you realise how everything depends on\\r\\nyour health, take care of yourself. I dare not tell you not to\\r\\nundertake so long a journey, and that, too, in the hot weather. At\\r\\nleast, if you are fit to make it, come by short stages; write me at\\r\\nevery sleeping-place, and despatch your letters in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my thoughts are concentrated in thy boudoir, in thy bed, on thy\\r\\nheart. Thy illness!--that is what occupies me night and day. Without\\r\\nappetite, without sleep, without care for my friends, for glory, for\\r\\nfatherland, you, you alone--the rest of the world exists no more for\\r\\nme than if it were annihilated. I prize honour since you prize it, I\\r\\nprize victory since it pleases you; without that I should leave\\r\\neverything in order to fling myself at your feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I tell myself that I alarm myself unnecessarily; that even\\r\\nnow she is better, that she is starting, has started, is perhaps\\r\\nalready at Lyons. Vain fancies! you are in bed suffering, more\\r\\nbeautiful, more interesting, more lovable. You are pale and your eyes\\r\\nare more languishing, but when will you be cured? If one of us ought\\r\\nto be ill it is I--more robust, more courageous; I should support\\r\\nillness more easily. Destiny is cruel, it strikes at me through you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat consoles me sometimes is to think that it is in the power of\\r\\ndestiny to make you ill; but it is in the power of no one to make me\\r\\nsurvive you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your letter, dear, be sure to tell me that you are convinced that I\\r\\nlove you more than it is possible to imagine; that you are persuaded\\r\\nthat all my moments are consecrated to you; that to think of any other\\r\\nwoman has never entered my head--they are all in my eyes without\\r\\ngrace, wit, or beauty; that you, you alone, such as I see you, such as\\r\\nyou are, can please me, and absorb all the faculties of my mind; that\\r\\nyou have traversed its whole extent; that my heart has no recess into\\r\\nwhich you have not seen, no thoughts which are not subordinate to\\r\\nyours; that my strength, my prowess, my spirit are all yours; that my\\r\\nsoul is in your body; and that the day on which you change or cease to\\r\\nlive will be my death-day; that Nature, that Earth, is beautiful only\\r\\nbecause you dwell therein. If you do not believe all this, if your\\r\\nsoul is not convinced, penetrated by it, you grieve me, you do not\\r\\nlove me--there is a magnetic fluid between people who love one\\r\\nanother--you know perfectly well that I could not brook a rival, much\\r\\nless offer you one.[15] To tear out his heart and to see him would be\\r\\nfor me one and the same thing, and then if I were to carry my hands\\r\\nagainst your sacred person--no, I should never dare to do it; but I\\r\\nwould quit a life in which the most virtuous of women had deceived\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am sure and proud of your love; misfortunes are the trials which\\r\\nreveal to each mutually the whole force of our passion. A child as\\r\\ncharming as its mamma will soon see the daylight, and will pass many\\r\\nyears in your arms. Hapless me! I would be happy with one _day_. A\\r\\nthousand kisses on your eyes, your lips, your tongue, your heart. Most\\r\\ncharming of thy sex, what is thy power over me? I am very sick of thy\\r\\nsickness; I have still a burning fever! Do not keep the courier more\\r\\nthan six hours, and let him return at once to bring me the longed-for\\r\\nletter of my Beloved.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you remember my dream, in which I was your boots, your dress, and\\r\\nin which I made you come bodily into my heart? Why has not Nature\\r\\narranged matters in this way; she has much to do yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n  N.

Is she so busy, that writing to her dear love is not\\r\\nthen needful for her, nor, consequently, thinking about him? To live\\r\\nwithout thinking of Josephine would be death and annihilation to your\\r\\nhusband. Your image gilds my fancies, and enlivens the black and\\r\\nsombre picture of melancholy and grief. A day perhaps may come in\\r\\nwhich I shall see you, for I doubt not you will be still at Paris, and\\r\\nverily on that day I will show you my pockets stuffed with letters\\r\\nthat I have not sent you because they are too foolish (_bete_). Yes,\\r\\nthat\\'s the word. Good heavens! tell me, you who know so well how to\\r\\nmake others love you without being in love yourself, do you know how\\r\\nto cure me of love??? I will give a good price for that remedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou ought to have started on May 24th. Being good-natured, I waited\\r\\ntill June 1st, as if a pretty woman would give up her habits, her\\r\\nfriends, both Madame Tallien and a dinner with Barras, and the acting\\r\\nof a new play, and Fortune; yes, Fortune, whom you love much more than\\r\\nyour husband, for whom you have only a little of the esteem, and a\\r\\nshare of that benevolence with which your heart abounds. Every day I\\r\\ncount up your misdeeds. I lash myself to fury in order to love you no\\r\\nmore. Bah, don\\'t I love you the more? In fact, my peerless little\\r\\nmother, I will tell you my secret. Set me at defiance, stay at Paris,\\r\\nhave lovers--let everybody know it--never write me a monosyllable!\\r\\nthen I shall love you ten times more for it; and it is not folly, a\\r\\ndelirious fever! and I shall not get the better of it. Oh! would to\\r\\nheaven I could get better! but don\\'t tell me you are ill, don\\'t try to\\r\\njustify yourself. Good heavens! you are pardoned. I love you to\\r\\ndistraction, and never will my poor heart cease to give all for love.\\r\\nIf you did not love me, my fate would be indeed grotesque. You have\\r\\nnot written me; you are ill, you do not come. But you have passed\\r\\nLyons; you will be at Turin on the 28th, at Milan on the 30th, where\\r\\nyou will wait for me. You will be in Italy, and I shall be still far\\r\\nfrom you. Adieu, my well-beloved; a kiss on thy mouth, another on thy\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have made peace with Rome--who gives us money. To-morrow we shall\\r\\nbe at Leghorn, and as soon as I can in your arms, at your feet, on\\r\\nyour bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _A la citoyenne Bonaparte, &c._\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n  _June 27th.--Leghorn occupied by Murat and Vaubois._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _June 29th.--Surrender of citadel of Milan; 1600 prisoners and 150\\r\\n  cannon taken._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [14] _Un millier de baise_ (sic).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [15] So Tennant (_t\\'en offrir un_): but Baron Feuillet de Conches, an\\r\\n       expert in Napoleonic graphology, renders the expression _t\\'en\\r\\n       souffrir un_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES B\\r\\n\\r\\n(1796-97)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Des 1796, lorsque, avec 30,000 hommes, il fait la conquete de l\\'Italie,\\r\\nil est non-seulement grand general, mais profond politique.\"--_Des\\r\\nIdees Napoleonniennes._\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Government has sent against me four armies without Generals, and\\r\\nthis time a General without an army.\"--_Napoleon to the Austrian\\r\\nPlenipotentiaries, at Leoben._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES B\\r\\n\\r\\n(For subjoined Notes to this Series see pages 211-223.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  LETTER                                                          PAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 1. _Sortie from Mantua_                                      211\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 2. _Marmirolo_                                               211\\r\\n          _Fortune_                                                212\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 3. _The village of Virgil_                                   212\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 4. _Achille_                                                 212\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 5. _Will-o\\'-the-Wisp_                                        213\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 6. _The needs of the army_                                 213-5\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 7. _Brescia_                                                 215\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 9. _I hope we shall get into Trent_                          216\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 12. _One of these nights the doors will be burst open_     216-8\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 13. _Corsica is ours_                                        218\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 14. _Verona_                                                 219\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 15. _Once more I breathe freely_                             220\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 18. \"_The 29th_\"                                             220\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 20. _General Brune_                                          221\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 21. _February 3rd_                                           221\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 24. _Perhaps I shall make peace with the Pope_               222\\r\\n\\r\\n  No. 25. _The unlimited power you hold over me_                   222\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _July 5th._--Archduke Charles defeated by Moreau at Radstadt.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _July 6th.--Sortie from Mantua: Austrians fairly successful._\\r\\n\\r\\nTO JOSEPHINE, AT MILAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Roverbella, July 6, 1796._\\r\\n\\r\\nI have beaten the enemy.

I am\\r\\ngrateful to you for the trouble you have taken to send me news; your\\r\\nhealth should be better to-day--I am sure you are cured. I urge you\\r\\nstrongly to ride, which cannot fail to do you good.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since I left you, I have been sad. I am only happy when by your\\r\\nside. Ceaselessly I recall your kisses, your tears, your enchanting\\r\\njealousy; and the charms of the incomparable Josephine keep constantly\\r\\nalight a bright and burning flame in my heart and senses. When, free\\r\\nfrom every worry, from all business, shall I spend all my moments by\\r\\nyour side, to have nothing to do but to love you, and to prove it to\\r\\nyou? I shall send your horse, but I am hoping that you will soon be\\r\\nable to rejoin me. I thought I loved you some days ago; but, since I\\r\\nsaw you, I feel that I love you even a thousand times more. Ever since\\r\\nI have known you, I worship you more every day; which proves how false\\r\\nis the maxim of La Bruyere that \"Love comes all at once.\" Everything\\r\\nin nature has a regular course, and different degrees of growth. Ah!\\r\\npray let me see some of your faults; be less beautiful, less gracious,\\r\\nless tender, and, especially, less kind; above all never be jealous,\\r\\nnever weep; your tears madden me, fire my blood. Be sure that it is no\\r\\nlonger possible for me to have a thought except for you, or an idea of\\r\\nwhich you shall not be the judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave a good rest. Haste to get well. Come and join me, so that, at\\r\\nleast, before dying, we could say--\"We were happy for so many days!!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of kisses, and even to Fortune, in spite of his naughtiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n  BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _July 18th.--Trenches opened before Mantua._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _July 18th._--Stuttgard occupied by Saint-Cyr, who, like Kleber,\\r\\n  is under Moreau.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _July 18th._--Wurtzburg captured by Klein and Ney (acting under\\r\\n  Jourdan).\\r\\n\\r\\nTO JOSEPHINE, AT MILAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Marmirolo, July 18, 1796_, 2 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nI passed the whole night under arms.

That is at least\\r\\nthe thirtieth time to-day that I have made this observation to myself;\\r\\nyou are thinking this particularly wearisome; yet you cannot doubt\\r\\nthe tender and unique anxiety with which you inspire me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe attacked Mantua yesterday. We warmed it up from two batteries with\\r\\nred-hot shot and from mortars. All night long that wretched town has\\r\\nbeen on fire. The sight was horrible and majestic. We have secured\\r\\nseveral of the outworks; we open the first parallel to-night.\\r\\nTo-morrow I start for Castiglione with the Staff, and I reckon on\\r\\nsleeping there. I have received a courier from Paris. There were two\\r\\nletters for you; I have read them. But though this action appears to\\r\\nme quite natural, and though you gave me permission to do so the other\\r\\nday, I fear you may be vexed, and that is a great trouble to me. I\\r\\nshould have liked to have sealed them up again: fie! that would have\\r\\nbeen atrocious. If I am to blame, I beg your forgiveness. I swear that\\r\\nit is not because I am jealous; assuredly not. I have too high an\\r\\nopinion of my beloved for that. I should like you to give me full\\r\\npermission to read your letters, then there would be no longer either\\r\\nremorse or apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nAchille has just ridden post from Milan; no letters from my beloved!\\r\\nAdieu, my unique joy. When will you be able to rejoin me? I shall have\\r\\nto fetch you myself from Milan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand kisses as fiery as my soul, as chaste as yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have summoned the courier; he tells me that he crossed over to your\\r\\nhouse, and that you told him you had no commands. Fie! naughty,\\r\\nundutiful, cruel, tyrannous, jolly little monster. You laugh at my\\r\\nthreats, at my infatuation; ah, you well know that if I could shut you\\r\\nup in my breast, I would put you in prison there!\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me you are cheerful, in good health, and very affectionate.\\r\\n\\r\\n  BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO JOSEPHINE, AT MILAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Castiglione, July 21, 1796_, 8 A.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am hoping that when I arrive to-night I shall get one of your\\r\\nletters. You know, my dear Josephine, the pleasure they give me; and I\\r\\nam sure you have pleasure in writing them. I shall start to-night for\\r\\nPeschiera, for the mountains of ----, for Verona, and thence I shall\\r\\ngo to Mantua, and perhaps to Milan, to receive a kiss, since you\\r\\nassure me they are not made of ice. I hope you will be perfectly well\\r\\nby then, and will be able to accompany me to headquarters, so that we\\r\\nmay not part again. Are you not the soul of my life, and the\\r\\nquintessence of my heart\\'s affections?\\r\\n\\r\\nYour proteges are a little excitable; they are like the will-o\\'-the-wisp.\\r\\nHow glad I am to do something for them which will please you.

Five or six days would be\\r\\nnecessary, and during that time movements may occur whereby my\\r\\npresence here would be imperative.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou assure me your health is good; I beg you therefore to come to\\r\\nBrescia. Even now I am sending Murat to prepare apartments for you\\r\\nthere in the town, as you desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think you will do well to spend the first night (July 24th) at\\r\\nCassano, setting out very late from Milan; and to arrive at Brescia on\\r\\nJuly 25th, where the most affectionate of lovers awaits you. I am\\r\\ndisconsolate that you can believe, dear, that my heart can reveal\\r\\nitself to others as to you; it belongs to you by right of conquest,\\r\\nand that conquest will be durable and for ever. I do not know why you\\r\\nspeak of Madame T., with whom I do not concern myself in the\\r\\nslightest, nor with the women of Brescia. As to the letters which you\\r\\nare vexed at my opening, this shall be the last; your letter had not\\r\\ncome.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, _ma tendre amie_, send me news often, come forthwith and join\\r\\nme, and be happy and at ease; all goes well, and my heart is yours for\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to return to the Adjutant-General Miollis the box of medals\\r\\nthat he writes me he has sent you. Men have such false tongues, and\\r\\nare so wicked, that it is necessary to have everything exactly on the\\r\\nsquare.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood health, love, and a prompt arrival at Brescia.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have at Milan a carriage suitable alike for town or country; you can\\r\\nmake use of it for the journey. Bring your plate with you, and some of\\r\\nthe things you absolutely require.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravel by easy stages, and during the coolth, so as not to tire\\r\\nyourself. Troops only take three days coming to Brescia. Travelling\\r\\npost it is only a fourteen hours\\' journey. I request you to sleep on\\r\\nthe 24th at Cassano; I shall come to meet you on the 25th at latest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, my own Josephine.

No letters from you for three days; and yet I have written to\\r\\nyou several times. To be parted is dreadful, the nights are long,\\r\\nstupid, and wearisome; the day\\'s work is monotonous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis evening, alone with my thoughts, work and correspondence, with\\r\\nmen and their stupid schemes, I have not even one letter from you\\r\\nwhich I might press to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Staff has gone; I set off in an hour.

You are naughty, and\\r\\nundutiful; very undutiful, as well as thoughtless. It is disloyal to\\r\\ndeceive a poor husband, an affectionate lover.

It was a dream, judge if it\\r\\nhas cured my fever. Your letters are as cold as if you were fifty; we\\r\\nmight have been married fifteen years. One finds in them the\\r\\nfriendship and feelings of that winter of life. Fie! Josephine. It is\\r\\nvery naughty, very unkind, very undutiful of you.

In a week Mantua will be ours, and\\r\\nthen your husband will clasp you in his arms, and give you a\\r\\nthousand proofs of his ardent affection.

You are a\\r\\ngood for nothing, very ungraceful, very tactless, very tatterdemalion.\\r\\nYou never write to me; you don\\'t care for your husband; you know the\\r\\npleasure your letters give him, and you write him barely half-a-dozen\\r\\nlines, thrown off anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow, then, do you spend the livelong day, madam? What business of\\r\\nsuch importance robs you of the time to write to your very kind lover?\\r\\nWhat inclination stifles and alienates love, the affectionate and\\r\\nunvarying love which you promised me? Who may this paragon be, this\\r\\nnew lover who engrosses all your time, is master of your days, and\\r\\nprevents you from concerning yourself about your husband? Josephine,\\r\\nbe vigilant; one fine night the doors will be broken in, and I shall\\r\\nbe before you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly, my dear, I am uneasy at getting no news from you. Write me four\\r\\npages immediately, and some of those charming remarks which fill my\\r\\nheart with the pleasures of imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that before long I shall clasp you in my arms, and cover you\\r\\nwith a million kisses as burning as if under the equator.\\r\\n\\r\\n  BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 17.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Verona, November 24, 1796._\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope soon, darling, to be in your arms.

You were not there. You\\r\\ngad about the towns amid junketings; you run farther from me when I am\\r\\nat hand; you care no longer for your dear Napoleon. A passing fancy\\r\\nmade you love him; fickleness renders him indifferent to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsed to perils, I know the remedy for weariness and the ills of life.\\r\\nThe ill-luck that I now suffer is past all calculations; I did right\\r\\nnot to anticipate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall be here till the evening of the 29th. Don\\'t alter your plans;\\r\\nhave your fling of pleasure; happiness was invented for you. The whole\\r\\nworld is only too happy if it can please you, and only your husband is\\r\\nvery, very unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO JOSEPHINE, AT GENOA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Milan_, _November 28, 1796_, 8 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received the courier whom Berthier had hurried on to Genoa. You\\r\\nhave not had time to write me, I feel it intuitively. Surrounded with\\r\\npleasures and pastimes, you would be wrong to make the least sacrifice\\r\\nfor me. Berthier has been good enough to show me the letter which you\\r\\nwrote him. My intention is that you should not make the least change\\r\\nin your plans, nor with respect to the pleasure parties in your\\r\\nhonour; I am of no consequence, either the happiness or the misery of\\r\\na man whom you don\\'t love is a matter of no moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my part, to love you only, to make you happy, to do nothing which\\r\\nmay vex you, that is the object and goal of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe happy, do not reproach me, do not concern yourself in the happiness\\r\\nof a man who lives only in your life, rejoices only in your pleasure\\r\\nand happiness. When I exacted from you a love like my own I was wrong;\\r\\nwhy expect lace to weigh as heavy as gold? When I sacrifice to you all\\r\\nmy desires, all my thoughts, every moment of my life, I obey the sway\\r\\nwhich your charms, your disposition, and your whole personality have\\r\\nso effectively exerted over my unfortunate heart. I was wrong, since\\r\\nnature has not given me attractions with which to captivate you; but\\r\\nwhat I do deserve from Josephine is her regard and esteem, for I love\\r\\nher frantically and uniquely.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarewell, beloved wife; farewell, my Josephine. May fate concentrate\\r\\nin my breast all the griefs and troubles, but may it give Josephine\\r\\nhappy and prosperous days. Who deserves them more? When it shall be\\r\\nquite settled that she can love me no more, I will hide my profound\\r\\ngrief, and will content myself with the power of being useful and\\r\\nserviceable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reopen my letter to give you a kiss....

I am sorry to find you in the dumps; yet you\\r\\nhave every reason to be cheerful. You are wrong to show so much\\r\\nkindness to people who show themselves unworthy of it.

I notice two things in it. You say I\\r\\ndo not read your letters: it is an unkind thought. I take your bad\\r\\nopinion anything but kindly. You tell me that perhaps it is a mere\\r\\nphantasy of the night, and you add that you are not jealous. I found\\r\\nout long ago that angry persons always assert that they are not angry;\\r\\nthat those who are afraid keep on repeating that they have no fear;\\r\\nyou therefore are convinced of jealousy. I am delighted to hear it!\\r\\nNevertheless, you are wrong; I think of nothing less, and in the\\r\\ndesert plains of Poland one thinks little about beauties....\\r\\n\\r\\nI had yesterday a ball of the provincial nobility--the women\\r\\ngood-looking enough, rich enough, dowdy enough, although in Paris\\r\\nfashions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, dear; I am in good health.--Yours ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n  NAPOLEON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Posen, December 3, 1806_, 6 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours of November 27th received, from which I see that your little\\r\\nhead is quite turned.

I am hoping to send for you in a\\r\\nfew days; that is, if circumstances will permit. The warmth of your\\r\\nletter makes me realise that you, like other pretty women, know no\\r\\nbounds. What you will, must be; but, as for me, I declare that of all\\r\\nmen I am the greatest slave; my master has no pity, and this master is\\r\\nthe nature of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, dear; keep well. The person that I wished to speak to you about\\r\\nis Madame L----, of whom every one is speaking ill; they assure me\\r\\nthat she is more Prussian than French woman.

Return to Paris in order\\r\\nto spend the winter there. Go to the Tuileries; receive, and lead the\\r\\nsame life as you are accustomed to do when I am there; that is my\\r\\nwish. Perhaps I shall not be long in rejoining you there; but it is\\r\\nabsolutely necessary for you to give up the idea of making a journey\\r\\nof 750 miles at this time of the year, through the enemy\\'s country,\\r\\nand in the rear of the army.

I had begged you\\r\\nto return to Paris. The season is too inclement, the roads unsafe and\\r\\ndetestable; the distances too great for me to permit you to come\\r\\nhither, where my affairs detain me. It would take you at least a month\\r\\nto come. You would arrive ill; by that time it might perhaps be\\r\\nnecessary to start back again; it would therefore be folly. Your\\r\\nresidence at Mayence is too dull; Paris reclaims you; go there, it is\\r\\nmy wish. I am more vexed about it than you.

I\\r\\nam in splendid health, sometimes rather wearied by the length of the\\r\\nnights.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to the present I have seen few people here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, dear.

Cut a suitable figure at Paris;\\r\\nand, above all, be contented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very well, and I love you much; but, if you are always crying, I\\r\\nshall think you without courage and without character.

I have laughed at what you say about your having taken a\\r\\nhusband to be with him.

It is not maternal; one should say, my glory consists in the\\r\\nhappiness of my children. Now, since nations--your husband, your\\r\\nchildren--can only be happy with a certain amount of glory, you must\\r\\nnot make little of it. Fie, Josephine! your heart is excellent and\\r\\nyour arguments weak. You feel acutely, but you don\\'t argue as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s sufficient quarrelling.

This\\r\\ndouble favour, Sire, dispels to a great extent the uneasiness, nay,\\r\\neven the fears which your Majesty\\'s long silence had inspired. I was\\r\\nafraid that I might be entirely banished from your memory; I see that\\r\\nI am not. I am therefore less wretched to-day, and even as happy as\\r\\nhenceforward it will be possible for me to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall go at the end of the month to Malmaison, since your Majesty\\r\\nsees no objection to it. But I ought to tell you, Sire, that I should\\r\\nnot so soon have taken advantage of the latitude which your Majesty\\r\\nleft me in this respect had the house of Navarre not required, for my\\r\\nhealth\\'s sake and for that of my household, repairs which are urgent.\\r\\nMy idea is to stay at Malmaison a very short time; I shall soon leave\\r\\nit in order to go to the waters. But while I am at Malmaison, your\\r\\nMajesty may be sure that I shall live there as if I were a thousand\\r\\nleagues from Paris. I have made a great sacrifice, Sire, and every day\\r\\nI realise more its full extent. Yet that sacrifice will be, as it\\r\\nought to be, a complete one on my part. Your Highness, amid your\\r\\nhappiness, shall be troubled by no expression of my regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall pray unceasingly for your Majesty\\'s happiness, perhaps even I\\r\\nshall pray that I may see you again; but your Majesty may be assured\\r\\nthat I shall always respect our new relationship. I shall respect it\\r\\nin silence, relying on the attachment that you had to me formerly; I\\r\\nshall call for no new proof; I shall trust to everything from your\\r\\njustice and your heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nI limit myself to asking from you one favour: it is, that you will\\r\\ndeign to find a way of sometimes convincing both myself and my\\r\\n_entourage_ that I have still a small place in your memory and a great\\r\\nplace in your esteem and friendship. By this means, whatever happens,\\r\\nmy sorrows will be mitigated without, as it seems to me, compromising\\r\\nthat which is of permanent importance to me, the happiness of your\\r\\nMajesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n  JOSEPHINE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1A.\\r\\n\\r\\n(_Reply of the Emperor Napoleon to the preceding._)\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE, AT NAVARRE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Compiegne, April 21, 1810._\\r\\n\\r\\n_My Dear_,--I have yours of April 18th; it is written in a bad style.\\r\\nI am always the same; people like me do not change. I know not what\\r\\nEugene has told you. I have not written to you because you have not\\r\\nwritten to me, and my sole desire is to fulfil your slightest\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see with pleasure that you are going to Malmaison and that you are\\r\\ncontented; as for me, I shall be so likewise on hearing news from you\\r\\nand in giving you mine. I say no more about it until you have compared\\r\\nthis letter with yours, and after that I will leave you to judge which\\r\\nof us two is the better friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, dear; keep well, and be just for your sake and mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  NAPOLEON.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n  _April 23rd._--Battle of Lerida.

My son\\r\\nhas just brought me your letter. With what impetuosity I read it, and\\r\\nyet I took a long time over it, for there was not a word which did not\\r\\nmake me weep; but these tears were very pleasant ones. I have found my\\r\\nwhole heart again--such as it will always be; there are affections\\r\\nwhich are life itself, and which can only end with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was in despair to find my letter of the 19th had displeased you; I\\r\\ndo not remember the exact expressions, but I know what torture I felt\\r\\nin writing it--the grief at having no news from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote you on my departure from Malmaison, and since then how often\\r\\nhave I wished to write you! but I appreciated the causes of your\\r\\nsilence and feared to be importunate with a letter. Yours has been the\\r\\ntrue balm for me. Be happy, be as much so as you deserve; it is my\\r\\nwhole heart which speaks to you. You have also just given me my share\\r\\nof happiness, and a share which I value the most, for nothing can\\r\\nequal in my estimation a proof that you still remember me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, dear; I again thank you as affectionately as I shall always\\r\\nlove you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  JOSEPHINE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2A.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE, AT THE CHATEAU NAVARRE.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Compiegne, April 28, 1810._\\r\\n\\r\\n_My Dear_,--I have just received two letters from you.

I shall return on May 15th.\\r\\n\\r\\nEugene tells me that you wish to go to the waters; trouble yourself\\r\\nabout nothing.

This is a minimum estimate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n_THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGNS, 1796-97_\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES A\\r\\n\\r\\n(_The numbers correspond to the numbers of the Letters._)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Bonaparte made Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Italy._--Marmont\\'s\\r\\naccount of how this came to pass is probably substantially correct, as\\r\\nhe has less interest in distorting the facts than any other writer as\\r\\nwell fitted for the task. The winter had rolled by in the midst of\\r\\npleasures--soirees at the Luxembourg, dinners of Madame Tallien,\\r\\n\"nor,\" he adds, \"were we hard to please.\" \"The Directory often\\r\\nconversed with General Bonaparte about the army of Italy, whose\\r\\ngeneral--Scherer--was always representing the position as difficult,\\r\\nand never ceasing to ask for help in men, victuals, and money. General\\r\\nBonaparte showed, in many concise observations, that all that was\\r\\nsuperfluous. He strongly blamed the little advantage taken from the\\r\\nvictory at Loano, and asserted that, even yet, all that could be put\\r\\nright. Thus a sort of controversy was maintained between Scherer and\\r\\nthe Directory, counselled and inspired by Bonaparte.\" At last when\\r\\nBonaparte drew up plans--afterwards followed--for the invasion of\\r\\nPiedmont, Scherer replied roughly that he who had drawn up the plan of\\r\\ncampaign had better come and execute it. They took him at his word,\\r\\nand Bonaparte was named General-in-Chief of the army of Italy (vol. i.\\r\\n93).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_7 A.M._\"--Probably written early in March. Leaving Paris on March\\r\\n11th, Napoleon writes Letourneur, President of the Directory, of his\\r\\nmarriage with the \"citoyenne Tascher Beauharnais,\" and tells him that\\r\\nhe has already asked Barras to inform them of the fact. \"The\\r\\nconfidence which the Directory has shown me under all circumstances\\r\\nmakes it my duty to keep it advised of all my actions. It is a new\\r\\nlink which binds me to the fatherland; it is one more proof of my\\r\\nfixed determination to find safety only in the Republic.\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Our good Ossian._\"--The Italian translation of Ossian by Cesarotti\\r\\nwas a masterpiece; better, in fact, than the original. He was a friend\\r\\nof Macpherson, and had learnt English in order to translate his work.\\r\\nCesarotti lived till an advanced age, and was sought out in his\\r\\nretirement in order to receive honours and pensions from the Emperor\\r\\nNapoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our good Ossian\" speaks, like Homer, of the joy of grief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Chauvet is dead._\"--Chauvet is first mentioned in Napoleon\\'s\\r\\ncorrespondence in a letter to his brother Joseph, August 9, 1795.\\r\\nMdme. Junot, _Memoirs_, i. 138, tells us that Bonaparte was very fond\\r\\nof him, and that he was a man of gentle manners and very ordinary\\r\\nconversation. She declares that Bonaparte had been a suitor for the\\r\\nhand of her mother shortly before his marriage with Josephine, and\\r\\nthat because the former rejected him, the general had refused a favour\\r\\nto her son; this had caused a quarrel which Chauvet had in vain tried\\r\\nto settle. On March 27th Bonaparte had written Chauvet from Nice that\\r\\nevery day that he delayed joining him, \"takes away from my operations\\r\\none chance of probability for their success.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Amand notes that Bonaparte begins to suspect his wife in this\\r\\nletter, while the previous ones, especially that of April 3rd, show\\r\\nperfect confidence. Napoleon is on the eve of a serious battle, and\\r\\nhas only just put his forces into fighting trim. On the previous day\\r\\n(April 6th) he wrote to the Directory that the movement against Genoa,\\r\\nof which he does not approve, has brought the enemy out of their\\r\\nwinter quarters almost before he has had time to make ready. \"The army\\r\\nis in a state of alarming destitution; I have still great difficulties\\r\\nto surmount, but they are surmountable: misery has excused want of\\r\\ndiscipline, and without discipline never a victory. I hope to have all\\r\\nin good trim shortly--there are signs already; in a few days we shall\\r\\nbe fighting. The Sardinian army consists of 50,000 foot, and 5000\\r\\nhorse; I have only 45,000 men at my disposal, all told. Chauvet, the\\r\\ncommissary-general, died at Genoa: it is a heavy loss to the army, he\\r\\nwas active and enterprising.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days later Napoleon, still at Albenga, reports that he has found\\r\\nRoyalist traitors in the army, and complains that the Treasury had not\\r\\nsent the promised pay for the men, \"but in spite of all, we shall\\r\\nadvance.\" Massena, eleven years older than his new commander-in-chief,\\r\\nhad received him coldly, but soon became his right-hand man, always\\r\\ngenial, and full of good ideas. Massena\\'s men are ill with too much\\r\\nsalt meat, they have hardly any shoes, but, as in 1800,[42] he has\\r\\nnever a doubt that Bonaparte will make a good campaign, and determines\\r\\nto loyally support him. Poor Laharpe, so soon to die, is a man of a\\r\\ndifferent stamp--one of those, doubtless, of whom Bonaparte thinks\\r\\nwhen he writes to Josephine, \"Men worry me.\" The Swiss, in fact, was a\\r\\nchronic grumbler, but a first-rate fighting man, even when his men\\r\\nwere using their last cartridges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The lovers of nineteen._\"--The allusion is lost. Aubenas, who\\r\\nreproduces two or three of these letters, makes a comment to this\\r\\nsentence, \"Nous n\\'avons pu trouver un nom a mettre sous cette\\r\\nfantasque imagination\" (vol. i. 317).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_My brother_,\" viz. Joseph.--He and Junot reached Paris in five days,\\r\\nand had a great ovation. Carnot, at a dinner-party, showed Napoleon\\'s\\r\\nportrait next to his heart, because \"I foresee he will be the saviour\\r\\nof France, and I wish him to know that he has at the Directory only\\r\\nadmirers and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Unalterably good._--\"C\\'est Joseph peint d\\'un seul trait.\"--Aubenas\\r\\n(vol. i. 320).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_If you want a place for any one, you can send him here. I will give\\r\\nhim one._\"--Bonaparte was beginning to feel firm in the saddle,\\r\\nwhile at Paris Josephine was treated like a princess. Under date\\r\\nApril 25th, Letourneur, as one of the Directory, writes him, \"A vast\\r\\ncareer opens itself before you; the Directory has measured the\\r\\nwhole extent of it.\" They little knew! The letter concludes by\\r\\nexpressing confidence that their general will never be reproached\\r\\nwith the shameful repose of Capua. In a further letter, bearing\\r\\nthe same date, Letourneur insists on a full and accurate account of\\r\\nthe battles being sent, as they will be necessary \"for the history of\\r\\nthe triumphs of the Republic.\" In a private letter to the Directory\\r\\n(No. 220, vol. i. of the _Correspondence_, 1858), dated Carru, April\\r\\n24th, Bonaparte tells them that when he returns to camp, worn-out,\\r\\nhe has to work all night to put matters straight, and repress\\r\\npillage. \"Soldiery without bread work themselves into an excess of\\r\\nfrenzy which makes one blush to be a man.\"[43]... \"I intend to make\\r\\nterrible examples. I shall restore order, or cease to command these\\r\\nbrigands. The campaign is not yet decided. The enemy is desperate,\\r\\nnumerous, and fights well. He knows I am in want of everything, and\\r\\ntrusts entirely to time; but I trust entirely to the good genius of\\r\\nthe Republic, to the bravery of the soldiers, to the harmony of the\\r\\nofficers, and even to the confidence they repose in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nAubenas goes into ecstasies over this letter, \"the longest, most\\r\\neloquent, and most impassioned of the whole series\" (vol. i. 322).\\r\\n\\r\\nFacsimile of Letter dated April 24, 1796.\\r\\n\\r\\n_June 15._--Here occurs the first gap in the correspondence, but\\r\\nhis letters to the Directory between this date and the last letter\\r\\nto Josephine extant (April 24) are full of interest, including his\\r\\nconscientious disobedience at Cherasco, and the aura of his destiny\\r\\nto \"ride the whirlwind and direct the storm\" which first inspired him\\r\\nafter Lodi. On April 28th was signed the armistice of Cherasco, by\\r\\nwhich his rear was secured by three strong fortresses.[44] He writes\\r\\nthe Directory that Piedmont is at their mercy, and that in making the\\r\\narmistice into a definite peace he trusts they will not forget the\\r\\nlittle island of Saint-Pierre, which will be more useful in the\\r\\nfuture than Corsica and Sardinia combined. He looks upon northern\\r\\nItaly as practically conquered, and speaks of invading Bavaria\\r\\nthrough the Tyrol. \"Prodigious\" is practically the verdict of the\\r\\nDirectory, and later of Jomini. \"My columns are marching; Beaulieu\\r\\nflees. I hope to catch him. I shall impose a contribution of some\\r\\nmillions on the Duke of Parma: he will sue for peace: don\\'t be in a\\r\\nhurry, so that I may have time to make him also contribute to the\\r\\ncost of the campaign, by replenishing our stores and rehorsing our\\r\\nwaggons at his expense.\" Bonaparte suggests that Genoa should pay\\r\\nfifteen millions indemnity for the frigates and vessels taken in the\\r\\nport. Certain risks had to be run in invading Lombardy, owing to want\\r\\nof horse artillery, but at Cherasco he secured artillery and horses.\\r\\nWhen writing to the Directory for a dozen companies, he tells them\\r\\nnot to entrust the execution of this measure \"to the men of the\\r\\nbureaus, for it takes them ten days to forward an order.\" Writing to\\r\\nCarnot on the same day he states he is marching against Beaulieu,\\r\\nwho has 26,000 foot out of 38,000 at commencement of campaign.\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s force is 28,000, but he has less cavalry. On May 1st, in a\\r\\nletter dated Acqui to Citizen Faipoult, he asks for particulars of\\r\\nthe pictures, statues, &c., of Milan, Parma, Placentia, Modena, and\\r\\nBologna. On the same day Massena writes that his men are needing\\r\\nshoes. On May 6th Bonaparte announces the capture of Tortona, \"a very\\r\\nfine fortress, which cost the King of Sardinia over fifteen\\r\\nmillions,\" while Cherasco has furnished him with twenty-eight guns.\\r\\nMeanwhile Massena has taken possession of Alessandria, with all its\\r\\nstores. On May 9th Napoleon writes to Carnot, \"We have at last\\r\\ncrossed the Po. The second campaign is begun; Beaulieu ... has\\r\\nfool-hardiness but no genius. One more victory, and Italy is ours.\" A\\r\\nclever commissary-general is all he needs, and his men are growing\\r\\nfat--with good meat and good wine. He sends to Paris twenty old\\r\\nmasters, with fine examples of Correggio and Michael-Angelo. It is\\r\\npleasant to find Napoleon\\'s confidence in Carnot, in view of Barras\\'\\r\\ninsinuations that the latter had cared only for Moreau--his type\\r\\nof Xenophon. In this very letter Napoleon writes Carnot, \"I owe you\\r\\nmy special thanks for the care that you have kindly given to my wife;\\r\\nI recommend her to you, she is a sincere patriot, and I love her to\\r\\ndistraction.\" He is sending \"a dozen millions\" to France, and hopes\\r\\nthat some of it will be useful to the army of the Rhine. Meanwhile,\\r\\nand two days before Napoleon\\'s letter to Carnot just mentioned, the\\r\\nlatter, on behalf of the Directory, suggests the division of his\\r\\ncommand with the old Alsatian General Kellermann. The Directory\\'s\\r\\nidea of a gilded pill seems to be a prodigiously long letter. It is\\r\\none of those heart-breaking effusions that, even to this day,\\r\\nemanate from board-rooms, to the dismay and disgust of their\\r\\nrecipients. After plastering him with sickening sophistries as to\\r\\nhis \"sweetest recompense,\" it gives the utterly unnecessary\\r\\nmonition, \"March! no fatal repose, there are still laurels to\\r\\ngather\"! Nevertheless, his plan of ending the war by an advance\\r\\nthrough the Tyrol strikes them as too risky. He is to conquer the\\r\\nMilanais, and then divide his army with Kellermann, who is to guard\\r\\nthe conquered province, while he goes south to Naples and Rome. As an\\r\\nimplied excuse for not sending adequate reinforcements, Carnot adds,\\r\\n\"The exaggerated rumours that you have skilfully disseminated as to\\r\\nthe numbers of the French troops in Italy, will augment the fear\\r\\nof our enemies and almost double your means of action.\" The\\r\\nMilanais is to be heavily mulcted, but he is to be prudent. If Rome\\r\\nmakes advances, his first demand should be that the Pope may order\\r\\nimmediate public prayers for the prosperity and success of the French\\r\\nRepublic! The sending of old masters to France to adorn her National\\r\\nGalleries seems to have been entirely a conception of Napoleon\\'s. He\\r\\nhas given sufficiently good reasons, from a patriotic point of view;\\r\\nfor money is soon spent, but a masterpiece may encourage Art among\\r\\nhis countrymen a generation later. The plunderers of the Parthenon of\\r\\n1800 could not henceforward throw stones at him in this respect. But\\r\\nhis real object was to win the people of Paris by thus sending them\\r\\nGlory personified in unique works of genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Directory, already jealous of his fame, endeavour to neutralise\\r\\nthe effect of his initiative by hearty concurrence, and write, \"Italy\\r\\nhas been illumined and enriched by their possession, but the time is\\r\\nnow come when their reign should pass to France to stablish and\\r\\nbeautify that of Liberty.\" The despatch adds somewhat naively that the\\r\\neffects of the vandalism committed during their own Republican orgies\\r\\nwould be obliterated by this glorious campaign, which should \"join to\\r\\nthe splendour of military trophies the charm of beneficent and restful\\r\\narts.\" The Directory ends by inviting him to choose one or two artists\\r\\nto select the most valuable pictures and other masterpieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Directory\\'s supineness in pushing on the war on the\\r\\nRhine is enabling the Austrians to send large reinforcements against\\r\\nNapoleon. Bonaparte, who has recently suffered (Jomini, vol. viii.\\r\\n113) from Kellermann\\'s tardiness in sending reinforcements at an\\r\\nimportant moment, replies to the letters of May 7th a week later, and\\r\\nwrites direct to Citizen Carnot from Lodi, as well as to the Executive\\r\\nDirectory. \"On the receipt of the Directory\\'s letter of the 7th your\\r\\nwishes were fulfilled, and the Milanais is ours. I shall shortly\\r\\nmarch, to carry out your intentions, on Leghorn and Rome; all that\\r\\nwill soon be done. I am writing the Directory relatively to their idea\\r\\nof dividing the army. I swear that I have no thought beyond the\\r\\ninterest of my country. Moreover, you will always find me straight\\r\\n(_dans la ligne droite_).... As it might happen that this letter to\\r\\nthe Directory may be badly construed, and since you have assured me\\r\\nof your friendship, I take this opportunity of addressing you, begging\\r\\nyou to make what use of it your prudence and attachment for me may\\r\\nsuggest.... Kellermann will command the army as well as I, for no one\\r\\nis more convinced than I am that the victories are due to the courage\\r\\nand pluck of the army; but I think joining Kellermann and myself in\\r\\nItaly is to lose everything. I cannot serve willingly with a man who\\r\\nconsiders himself the first general in Europe; and, besides, I believe\\r\\none bad general is better than two good ones. War is like government:\\r\\nit is an affair of tact. To be of any use, I must enjoy the same\\r\\nconfidence that you testified to me in Paris. Where I make war, here\\r\\nor there, is a matter of indifference. To serve my country, to deserve\\r\\nfrom posterity a page in our history, to give the Government proofs of\\r\\nmy attachment and devotion--that is the sum of my ambition. But I am\\r\\nvery anxious not to lose in a week the fatigues, anxieties, and\\r\\ndangers of two months, and to find myself fettered. I began with a\\r\\ncertain amount of fame; I wish to continue worthy of you.\" To the\\r\\nDirectory he writes that the expeditions to Leghorn, Rome, and Naples\\r\\nare small affairs, but to be safely conducted must have one general in\\r\\ncommand. \"I have made the campaign without consulting a soul; I should\\r\\nhave done no good if I had had to share my views with another. I have\\r\\ngained some advantages over superior forces, and in utter want of\\r\\neverything, because, certain of your confidence, my marches have been\\r\\nas quick as my thoughts.\" He foretells disaster if he is shackled with\\r\\nanother general. \"Every one has his own method of making war. General\\r\\nKellermann has more experience, and will do it better than I; but both\\r\\ntogether will do it very badly.\" With Barras he knew eloquence was\\r\\nuseless, and therefore bribed him with a million francs. On May 10th\\r\\nwas gained the terrible battle of the Bridge of Lodi, where he won\\r\\npromotion from his soldiers, and became their \"little corporal,\" and\\r\\nwhere he told Las Cases that he \"was struck with the possibility of\\r\\nbecoming famous. It was then that the first spark of my ambition was\\r\\nkindled.\" On entering Milan he told Marmont, \"Fortune has smiled on me\\r\\nto-day, only because I despise her favours; she is a woman, and the\\r\\nmore she does for me, the more I shall exact from her. In our day no\\r\\none has originated anything great; it is for me to give the example.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 15th, thirty-five days after the commencement of the campaign,\\r\\nhe entered Milan, under a triumphal arch and amid the acclamations of\\r\\nthe populace. On the previous evening he was guilty of what Dr.\\r\\nJohnson would have considered a fitting herald of his spoliation of\\r\\npicture-galleries--the perpetration of a pun. At a dinner-table the\\r\\nhostess observed that his youth was remarkable in so great a\\r\\nconqueror, whereat he replied, \"Truly, madam, I am not very old at\\r\\npresent--barely twenty-seven--but in less than twenty-four hours I\\r\\nshall count many more, for I shall have attained Milan\" (_mille\\r\\nans_).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 22nd he returned to Lodi, but heard immediately that Lombardy\\r\\nin general, and Pavia in particular, was in open revolt. He makes a\\r\\nterrible example of Pavia, shooting its chief citizens, and, for the\\r\\nonly time, giving up a town to three hours\\' pillage. The Directory\\r\\ncongratulates him on these severe measures: \"The laws of war and the\\r\\nsafety of the army render them legitimate in such circumstances.\" He\\r\\nwrites them that had the blood of a single Frenchman been spilt, he\\r\\nwould have erected a column on the ruins of Pavia, on which should\\r\\nhave been inscribed, \"Here was the town of Pavia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 21st, Carnot replies to the letter from Lodi: \"You appear\\r\\ndesirous, citizen general, of continuing to conduct the whole series\\r\\nof military operations in Italy, at the actual seat of war. The\\r\\nDirectory has carefully considered your proposition, and the\\r\\nconfidence that they place in your talents and republican zeal has\\r\\ndecided this question in the affirmative.... The rest of the military\\r\\noperations towards the Austrian frontier and round Mantua are\\r\\nabsolutely dependent on your success against Beaulieu. The Directory\\r\\nfeels how difficult it would be to direct them from Paris. It leaves\\r\\nto you in this respect the greatest latitude, while recommending the\\r\\nmost extreme prudence. Its intention is, however, that the army shall\\r\\ncross into the Tyrol only after the expedition to the south of\\r\\nItaly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a complete victory for Bonaparte (Bingham calls it the\\r\\nDirectory\\'s \"abject apology\"), and, as Scott points out, he now\\r\\n\"obtained an ascendency which he took admirable care not to\\r\\nrelinquish; and it became the sole task of the Directory, so far as\\r\\nItaly was concerned, to study phrases for intimating their approbation\\r\\nof the young general\\'s measures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had forged a sword for France, and he now won her heart by gilding\\r\\nit. On May 16th the Directory had asked him to supply Kellermann with\\r\\nmoney for the army of the Alps, and by May 22nd he is able to write\\r\\nthat six or eight million francs in gold, silver, ingots, or jewels is\\r\\nlying at their disposal with one of the best bankers in Genoa, being\\r\\nsuperfluous to the needs of the army. \"If you wish it, I can have a\\r\\nmillion sent to Bale for the army of the Rhine.\" He has already helped\\r\\nKellermann, and paid his men. He also announces a further million\\r\\nrequisitioned from Modena. \"As it has neither fortresses nor muskets,\\r\\nI could not ask for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHenceforth he lubricates the manifold wheels of French policy with\\r\\nItalian gold, and gains thereby the approbation and gratitude of the\\r\\nFrench armies and people. Meanwhile he does not neglect those who\\r\\nmight bear him a grudge. To Kellermann and to all the Directors he\\r\\nsends splendid chargers. From Parma he has the five best pictures\\r\\nchosen for Paris--the Saint Jerome and the Madonna della Scodella,\\r\\nboth by Correggio; the Preaching of St. John in the Desert, a Paul\\r\\nVeronese, and a Van Dyck, besides fine examples of Raphael, Caracci,\\r\\n&c.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Directory is anxious that he shall chastise the English at\\r\\nLeghorn, as the fate of Corsica is somewhat dependent on it, whose\\r\\nloss \"will make London tremble.\" They secretly dread a war in the\\r\\nTyrol, forgetting that Bonaparte is a specialist in mountain fighting,\\r\\neducated under Paoli. They remind him that he has not sent the plans\\r\\nof his battles. \"You ought not to lack draughtsmen in Italy. Eh! what\\r\\nare your young engineer officers doing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 31st Carnot writes to urge him to press the siege of Mantua,\\r\\nreasserting that the reinforcements which Beaulieu has received will\\r\\nnot take from that army its sense of inferiority, and that ten\\r\\nbattalions of Hoche\\'s army are on the way. It approves and confirms\\r\\nthe \"generous fraternity\" with which Bonaparte offers a million francs\\r\\nto the armies on the Rhine. On June 7th he tells the Directory that\\r\\nRome is about to fulminate a bull against the French Royalists, but\\r\\nthat he thinks the expedition to Naples should be deferred, and also a\\r\\nquarrel with Venice--at least till he has beaten his other enemies; it\\r\\nis not expedient to tackle every one at once. On June 6th he thanks\\r\\nCarnot for a kind letter, adding that the best reward to sweeten\\r\\nlabour and perils is the esteem of the few men one really admires. He\\r\\nfears the hot weather for his men: \"we shall soon be in July, when\\r\\nevery march will cost us 200 sick.\" The same day he writes General\\r\\nClarke that all is flourishing, but that the dog-star is coming on at\\r\\na gallop, and that there is no remedy against its malign influence.\\r\\n\"Luckless beings that we are! Our position with nature is merely\\r\\nobservation, without control.\" He holds that the only safe way to end\\r\\nthe campaign without being beaten is not to go to the south of Italy.\\r\\nOn the 9th he thanks Kellermann for the troops he sends, and their\\r\\nexcellent discipline. On the 11th--always as anxious to help his\\r\\ngenerals as himself--he urges the Directory to press the Swiss\\r\\nGovernment to refund La Harpe\\'s property to his children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Presentiment of ill._\"--Marmont tells us what this was. The glass of\\r\\nhis wife\\'s portrait, which he always carried with him, was found to be\\r\\nbroken. Turning frightfully pale, he said to Marmont, \"My wife is\\r\\neither very ill, or unfaithful.\" She left Paris June 24th. Marmont\\r\\nsays, \"Once at Milan, General Bonaparte was very happy, for at that\\r\\ntime he lived only for his wife.... Never love more pure, more true,\\r\\nmore exclusive, has possessed the heart of any man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween June 15th and the renewal of Josephine\\'s correspondence a\\r\\nglance at the intervening dates will show that Bonaparte and his army\\r\\nwere not wasting time. The treaty with Rome was a masterpiece, as in\\r\\naddition to money and works of art, he obtained the port of Ancona,\\r\\nsiege-guns with which to bombard Mantua, and best of all, a letter\\r\\nfrom the Pope to the faithful of France, recommending submission to\\r\\nthe new government there. In consideration of this, and possibly\\r\\nyielding to the religious sentiments of Josephine, he spared Rome his\\r\\npresence--the only capital which he abstained from entering, when he\\r\\nhad, as in the present case, the opportunity. It was not, however,\\r\\nuntil February 1797 that the Pope fulfilled his obligations under this\\r\\nTreaty, and then under new compulsion.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Fortune._--Josephine\\'s dog (see note to Letter 2, Series B).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [41] No. 89 of Napoleon III.\\'s Correspondence of Napoleon I., vol. i.,\\r\\n       the last letter signed Buonaparte; after March 24 we only find\\r\\n       Bonaparte.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [42] Compelled to surrender Genoa, before Marengo takes place, he\\r\\n       swears to the Austrian general he will be back there in\\r\\n       fourteen days, and keeps his word.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [43] Two days later he evidently feels this letter too severe, and\\r\\n       writes: \"All goes well. Pillage is less pronounced. This first\\r\\n       thirst of an army destitute of everything is quenched. The poor\\r\\n       fellows are excusable; after having sighed for three years at\\r\\n       the top of the Alps, they arrive in the Promised Land, and wish\\r\\n       to taste of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [44] Bingham, with his customary ill-nature, remarks that Bonaparte,\\r\\n       \"in spite of the orders of the Directory, took upon himself to\\r\\n       sign the armistice.\" These orders, dated March 6th, were\\r\\n       intended for a novice, and no longer applicable to the\\r\\n       conqueror of two armies, and which a Despatch on the way, dated\\r\\n       April 25th, already modified. Jomini admits the wisdom of this\\r\\n       advantageous peace, which secured Nice and Savoy to France, and\\r\\n       gave her all the chief mountain-passes leading into Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES B\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 6, Sortie from Mantua of the Austrians._--According to Jomini\\r\\nthe French on this occasion were not successful (vol. viii. 162). In\\r\\none of his several letters to the Directory on this date is seen\\r\\nBonaparte\\'s anxiety for reinforcements; the enemy has already 67,000\\r\\nmen against his available 40,000. Meanwhile he is helping the\\r\\nCorsicans to throw off the British yoke, and believes that the French\\r\\npossession of Leghorn will enable the French to gain that island\\r\\nwithout firing a shot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Marmirolo._--On July 12th he writes to the Directory from Verona that\\r\\nfor some days he and the enemy have been watching each other. \"Woe to\\r\\nhim who makes a false move.\" He indicates that he is about to make a\\r\\n_coup de main_ on Mantua, with 300 men dressed in Austrian uniforms.\\r\\nHe is by no means certain of success, which \"depends entirely on\\r\\nluck--either on a dog[45] or a goose.\" He complains of much sickness\\r\\namong his men round Mantua, owing to the heat and miasmata from the\\r\\nmarshes, but so far no deaths. He will be ready to make Venice\\r\\ndisgorge a few millions shortly, if the Directory make a quarrel in\\r\\nthe interim.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 13th he was with Josephine, as he writes from Milan, but leaves\\r\\non the 14th, and on the 17th is preparing a _coup de_ _main_ with 800\\r\\ngrenadiers, which, as we see from the next letter, fails.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Fortune._--Arnault tells an anecdote of this lap-dog, which in 1794,\\r\\nin the days of the Terror, had been used as a bearer of secret\\r\\ndespatches between Josephine in prison and the governess of her\\r\\nchildren outside the grille. Henceforward Josephine would never be\\r\\nparted from it. One day in June 1797 the dog was lying on the same\\r\\ncouch as its mistress, and Bonaparte, accosting Arnault and pointing\\r\\nto the dog with his finger, said, \"You see that dog there. He is my\\r\\nrival. He was in possession of Madame\\'s bed when I married her. I\\r\\nwished to make him get out--vain hope! I was told I must resign\\r\\nmyself to sleep elsewhere, or consent to share with him. That was\\r\\nsufficiently exasperating, but it was a question of taking or\\r\\nleaving, and I resigned myself. The favourite was less accommodating\\r\\nthan I. I bear the proof of it in this leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot content with barking at every one, he bit not only men but other\\r\\ndogs, and was finally killed by a mastiff, much to Bonaparte\\'s secret\\r\\nsatisfaction; for, as St. Amand adds, \"he could easily win battles,\\r\\naccomplish miracles, make or unmake principalities, but could not show\\r\\na dog the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The village of Virgil._\"--Michelet (Jusqu\\'au 18 _Brumaire_) thinks\\r\\nthat here he got the idea of the Fete of Virgil, established a few\\r\\nmonths later. In engravings of the hero of Italy we see him near the\\r\\ntomb of Virgil, his brows shaded by a laurel crown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Achille._--Murat. He had been appointed one of Bonaparte\\'s\\r\\naides-de-camp February 29th, made General of Brigade after the Battle\\r\\nof Lodi (May 10th); is sent to Paris after Junot with nine trophies,\\r\\nand arrives there first. He flirts there outrageously with Josephine,\\r\\nbut does not escort her back to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'_Will o\\' the wisp_,\\' _i.e._ _l\\'ardent_.--This word, according to\\r\\nMenage, was given by the Sieur de St. Germain to those lively young\\r\\nsparks who, about the year 1634, used to meet at the house of Mr.\\r\\nMarsh (M. de Marest), who was one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The needs of the army._--Difficulties were accumulating, and Napoleon\\r\\nwas, as he admits at St. Helena, seriously alarmed. Wurmser\\'s force\\r\\nproves to be large, Piedmont is angry with the Republic and ready to\\r\\nrise, and Venice and Rome would willingly follow its example; the\\r\\nEnglish have taken Porto-Ferrajo, and their skilful minister, Windham,\\r\\nis sowing the seeds of discord at Naples. Although on July 20th he has\\r\\nwritten a friend in Corsica that \"all smiles on the Republic,\" he\\r\\nwrites Saliceti, another brother Corsican, very differently on August\\r\\n1st. \"Fortune appears to oppose us at present.... I have raised the\\r\\nsiege of Mantua; I am at Brescia with nearly all my army. I shall take\\r\\nthe first opportunity of fighting a battle with the enemy which will\\r\\ndecide the fate of Italy--if I\\'m beaten, I shall retire on the Adda;\\r\\nif I win, I shall not stop in the marshes of Mantua.... Let the\\r\\ncitadels of Milan, Tortona, Alessandria, and Pavia be provisioned....\\r\\nWe are all very tired; I have ridden five horses to death.\" Reading\\r\\nbetween the lines of this letter to Josephine, it is evident that he\\r\\nthinks she will be safer with him than at Milan--Wurmser having the\\r\\noption of advancing _via_ Brescia on Milan, and cutting off the French\\r\\ncommunications. The Marshal\\'s fatal mistake was in using only half his\\r\\narmy for the purpose. This raising of the siege of Mantua (July 31st)\\r\\nwas heart-rending work for Bonaparte, but, as Jomini shows, he had no\\r\\nartillery horses, and it was better to lose the siege train,\\r\\nconsisting of guns taken from the enemy, than to jeopardise the whole\\r\\narmy. Wurmser had begun his campaign successfully by defeating\\r\\nMassena, and pushing back Sauret at Salo. \"The Austrians,\" wrote\\r\\nMassena, \"are drunk with brandy, and fight furiously,\" while his men\\r\\nare famished and can only hang on by their teeth. Bonaparte calls his\\r\\nfirst war council, and thinks for a moment of retreat, but Augereau\\r\\ninsists on fighting, which is successfully accomplished while Wurmser\\r\\nis basking himself among the captured artillery outside Mantua.\\r\\nBonaparte had been perfectly honest in telling the Directory his\\r\\ndifficulties, and sends his brother Louis to the Directory for that\\r\\npurpose on the eve of battle. He is complimented in a letter from the\\r\\nDirectory dated August 12th--a letter probably the more genuine as\\r\\nthey had just received a further despatch announcing a victory. On\\r\\nAugust 3rd Bonaparte won a battle at Lonato, and the next day Augereau\\r\\ngained great laurels at Castiglione; in later years the Emperor often\\r\\nincited Augereau by referring to those \"fine days of Castiglione.\"\\r\\nBetween July 29th and August 12th the French army took 15,000\\r\\nprisoners, 70 guns, and wounded or killed 25,000, with little more\\r\\nthan half the forces of the Austrians. Bonaparte gives his losses at\\r\\n7000, exclusive of the 15,000 sick he has in hospital; from July 31st\\r\\nto August 6th he never changed his boots, or lay down in a bed.\\r\\nNevertheless, Jomini thinks that he showed less vigour in the\\r\\nexecution of his plans than in the earlier part of the campaign; but,\\r\\nas an opinion _per contra_, we may note that the French grenadiers\\r\\nmade their \"little Corporal\" _Sergeant_ at Castiglione. Doubtless the\\r\\nproximity of his wife at the commencement (July 31st) made him more\\r\\ncareful, and therefore less intrepid. On August 18th he wrote\\r\\nKellermann with an urgent request for troops. On August 17th Colonel\\r\\nGraham, after hinting at the frightful excesses committed by the\\r\\nAustrians in their retreat, adds in a postscript--\"From generals to\\r\\nsubalterns the universal language of the army is that we must make\\r\\npeace, as we do not know how to make war.\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 13th Bonaparte sent to the Directory his opinion of most of\\r\\nhis generals, in order to show that he required some better ones. Some\\r\\nof his criticisms are interesting:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  Berthier--\"Talents, activity, courage, character; he has them\\r\\n  all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Augereau--\"Much character, courage, firmness, activity; is\\r\\n\\r\\n  accustomed to war, beloved by the soldiers, lucky in his\\r\\n  operations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Massena--\"Active, indefatigable, has boldness, grasp, and\\r\\n  promptitude in making his decisions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Serrurier--\"Fights like a soldier, takes no responsibility;\\r\\n  determined, has not much opinion of his troops, is often ailing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Despinois--\"Flabby, inactive, slack, has not the genius for war,\\r\\n  is not liked by the soldiers, does not fight with his head; has\\r\\n  nevertheless good, sound political principles: would do well to\\r\\n  command in the interior.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  Sauret--\"A good, very good soldier, not sufficiently enlightened\\r\\n  to be a general; unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf eight more he has little good to say, but the Directory in\\r\\nacknowledging his letter of August 23rd remarks that he has forgotten\\r\\nseveral officers, and especially the Irish general Kilmaine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the same time Colonel Graham (Lord Lynedoch) was writing to the\\r\\nBritish Government from Trent that the Austrians, despite their\\r\\ndefeats, were \"undoubtedly brave fine troops, and an able chief would\\r\\nput all to rights in a little time.\"[47] On August 18th he adds--\"When\\r\\nthe wonderful activity, energy, and attention that prevail in the\\r\\nFrench service, from the commander-in-chief downward, are compared to\\r\\nthe indecision, indifference, and indolence universal here, the\\r\\nsuccess of their rash but skilful manoeuvres is not surprising.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Brescia._--Napoleon was here on July 27th, meeting Josephine about\\r\\nthe date arranged (July 25th), and she returned with him. On July 29th\\r\\nthey were nearly captured by an Austrian ambuscade near Ceronione, and\\r\\nJosephine wept with fright. \"Wurmser,\" said Napoleon, embracing her,\\r\\n\"shall pay dearly for those tears.\" She accompanies him to Castel\\r\\nNova, and sees a skirmish at Verona; but the sight of wounded men\\r\\nmakes her leave the army, and, finding it impossible to reach Brescia,\\r\\nshe flees _via_ Ferrara and Bologna to Lucca. She leaves the French\\r\\narmy in dire straits and awaits news anxiously, while the Senate of\\r\\nLucca presents her with the oil kept exclusively for royalty. Thence\\r\\nshe goes _via_ Florence to Milan. By August 7th the Austrian army was\\r\\nbroken and in full retreat, and Bonaparte conducts his correspondence\\r\\nfrom Brescia from August 11th to 18th. On the 25th he is at Milan,\\r\\nwhere he meets his wife after her long pilgrimage, and spends four\\r\\ndays. By August 30th he is again at Brescia, and reminds her that he\\r\\nleft her \"vexed, annoyed, and not well.\" From a letter to her aunt,\\r\\nMadame de Renaudin, at this time, quoted by Aubenas, we can see her\\r\\nreal feelings: \"I am feted wherever I go; all the princes of Italy\\r\\ngive me fetes, even the Grand Duke of Tuscany, brother of the Emperor.\\r\\nAh, well, I prefer being a private individual in France. I care not\\r\\nfor honours bestowed in this country. I get sadly bored. My health has\\r\\nundoubtedly a great deal to do with making me unhappy; I am often out\\r\\nof sorts. If happiness could assure health, I ought to be in the best\\r\\nof health. I have the most amiable husband imaginable. I have no time\\r\\nto long for anything. My wishes are his. He is all day long in\\r\\nadoration before me, as if I were a divinity; there could not possibly\\r\\nbe a better husband. M. Serbelloni will tell you how he loves me. He\\r\\noften writes to my children; he loves them dearly. He is sending\\r\\nHortense, by M. Serbelloni, a lovely repeater, jewelled and enamelled;\\r\\nto Eugene a splendid gold watch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I hope we shall get into Trent by the 5th._\"--He entered the city on\\r\\nthat day. In his pursuit of Wurmser, he and his army cover sixty miles\\r\\nin two days, through the terrific Val Saguna and Brenta gorges,\\r\\nbrushing aside opposition by the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 12.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_One of these nights the doors will be burst open with a\\r\\nbang._\"--Apparently within two or three days, for Bonaparte is at\\r\\nMilan on September 21st, and stays with his wife till October 12th.\\r\\nOn October 1st he writes to the Directory that his total forces are\\r\\nonly 27,900; and that the Austrians, within six weeks, will have\\r\\n50,000. He asks for 26,000 more men to end the war satisfactorily: \"If\\r\\nthe preservation of Italy is dear to you, citizen directors, send me\\r\\nhelp.\" On the 8th they reply with the promise of 10,000 to 12,000, to\\r\\nwhich he replies (October 11th) that if 10,000 have started only 5000\\r\\nwill reach him. The Directory at this time are very poverty stricken,\\r\\nand ask him once more to pay Kellermann\\'s Army of the Alps, as being\\r\\n\"to some extent part of that which you command.\" This must have been\\r\\n\"nuts and wine\" for the general who was to have been superseded by\\r\\nKellermann a few months earlier. On October 1st they advise him that\\r\\nWurmser\\'s name is on the list of emigrants, and that if the Marshal\\r\\nwill surrender Mantua at once he need not be sent to Paris for trial.\\r\\nIf, however, Bonaparte thinks that this knowledge will make the old\\r\\nMarshal more desperate, he is not to be told. Bonaparte, of course,\\r\\ndoes not send the message. For some time these letters had been signed\\r\\nby the President Lareveillere Lepeaux, but on September 19th there was\\r\\na charming letter from Carnot: \"Although accustomed to unprecedented\\r\\ndeeds on your part, our hopes have been surpassed by the victory of\\r\\nBassano. What glory is yours, immortal Bonaparte! Moreau was about to\\r\\neffect a juncture with you when that wretched _reculade_ of Jourdan\\r\\nupset all our plans. Do not forget that immediately the armies go into\\r\\nwinter quarters on the Rhine the Austrians will have forces available\\r\\nto help Wurmser.\" At Milan Bonaparte advises the Directory that he is\\r\\ndealing with unpunished \"fripponeries\" in the commissariat department.\\r\\nHere he receives from young Kellermann, afterwards the hero of\\r\\nMarengo, a _precis_ of the condition of the Brescia fever-hospitals,\\r\\ndated October 6th: \"A wretched mattress, dirty and full of vermin, a\\r\\ncoarse sheet to each bed, rarely washed, no counterpanes, much\\r\\ndilatoriness, such is the spectacle that the fever-hospitals of\\r\\nBrescia present; it is heart-rending. The soldiers justly complain\\r\\nthat, having conquered opulent Italy at the cost of their life-blood,\\r\\nthey might, without enjoying comforts, at least find the help and\\r\\nattention which their situation demands. Bread and rice are the only\\r\\npassable foods, but the meat is hard. I beg that the general-in-chief\\r\\nwill immediately give attention to his companions in glory, who wish\\r\\nfor restored health only that they may gather fresh laurels.\" Thus\\r\\nBonaparte had his Bloemfontein, and perhaps his Burdett-Coutts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 12th he tells the Directory that Mantua will not fall till\\r\\nFebruary--the exact date of its capitulation. One is tempted to wonder\\r\\nif Napoleon was human enough to have inserted one little paragraph of\\r\\nhis despatch of October 12th from Milan with one eye on its perusal by\\r\\nhis wife, as it contains a veiled sneer at Hoche\\'s exploits: \"Send me\\r\\nrather generals of brigade than generals of division. All that comes\\r\\nto us from La Vendee is unaccustomed to war on a large scale; we have\\r\\nthe same reproach against the troops, but they are well-hardened.\" On\\r\\nthe same day he shows them that all the marvels of his six months\\'\\r\\ncampaign have cost the French Government only L440,000 (eleven million\\r\\nfrancs). He pleads, however, for special auditors to have charge of\\r\\nthe accounts. Napoleon had not only made war support war, but had sent\\r\\ntwenty million francs requisitioned in Italy to the Republic. On\\r\\nOctober 12th he leaves Milan for Modena, where he remains from the\\r\\n14th to the 18th, is at Bologna on the 19th, and Ferrara from the 19th\\r\\nto the 22nd, reaching Verona on the 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\nJomini has well pointed out that Napoleon\\'s conception of making two\\r\\nor three large Italian republics in place of many small ones minimised\\r\\nthe power of the Pope, and also that of Austria, by abolishing its\\r\\nfeudal rigours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Bonaparte is heartily sick of the war. On October 2nd he\\r\\nwrites direct to the Emperor of Germany: \"Europe wants peace. This\\r\\ndisastrous war has lasted too long;\" and on the 16th to Marshal\\r\\nWurmser: \"The siege of Mantua, sir, is more disastrous than two\\r\\ncampaigns.\" His weariness is tempered with policy, as Alvinzi was _en\\r\\nroute_, and the French reinforcements had not arrived, not even the\\r\\n10,000 promised in May.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Corsica is ours._\"--At St. Helena he told his generals, \"The King of\\r\\nEngland wore the Corsican crown only two years. This whim cost the\\r\\nBritish treasury five millions sterling. John Bull\\'s riches could not\\r\\nhave been worse employed.\" He writes to the Directory on the same day:\\r\\n\"The expulsion of the English from the Mediterranean has considerable\\r\\ninfluence on the success of our military operations in Italy. We can\\r\\nexact more onerous conditions from Naples, which will have the\\r\\ngreatest moral effect on the minds of the Italians, assures our\\r\\ncommunications, and makes Naples tremble as far as Sicily.\" On October\\r\\n25th he writes: \"Wurmser is at his last gasp; he is short of wine,\\r\\nmeat, and forage; he is eating his horses, and has 15,000 sick. In\\r\\nfifty days Mantua will either be taken or delivered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 14.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Verona._--Bonaparte had made a long stay at Verona, to November 4th,\\r\\nwaiting reinforcements which never came. On November 5th he writes to\\r\\nthe Directory: \"All the troops of the Directory arrive post-haste at\\r\\nan alarming rate, and we--we are left to ourselves. Fine promises and\\r\\na few driblets of men are all we have received;\" and on November 13th\\r\\nhe writes again: \"Perchance we are on the eve of losing Italy. None of\\r\\nthe expected reinforcements have arrived.... I am doing my duty, the\\r\\nofficers and men are doing theirs; my heart is breaking, but my\\r\\nconscience is at rest. Help--send me help!... I despair of preventing\\r\\nthe relief of Mantua, which in a week would have been ours. The\\r\\nwounded are the pick of the army; all our superior officers, all our\\r\\npicked generals are _hors de combat_; those who have come to me are so\\r\\nincompetent, and they have not the soldiers\\' confidence. The army of\\r\\nItaly, reduced to a handful of men, is exhausted. The heroes of Lodi,\\r\\nMillesimo, Castiglione, and Bassano have died for their country, or\\r\\nare in hospital;[48] to the corps remain only their reputation and\\r\\ntheir glory. Joubert, Lannes, Lanusse, Victor, Murat, Chabot, Dupuy,\\r\\nRampon, Pijon, Menard, Chabran, and St. Hilaire are wounded.... In a\\r\\nfew days we shall make a last effort. Had I received the 83rd, 3500\\r\\nstrong, and of good repute in the army, I would have answered for\\r\\neverything. Perhaps in a few days 40,000 will not suffice.\" The reason\\r\\nfor this unwonted pessimism was the state of his troops. His brother\\r\\nLouis reported that Vaubois\\' men had no shoes and were almost naked,\\r\\nin the midst of snow and mountains; that desertions were taking place\\r\\nof soldiers with bare and bleeding feet, who told the enemy the plans\\r\\nand conditions of their army. Finally Vaubois bungles, through not\\r\\nknowing the ground, and is put under the orders of Massena, while two\\r\\nof his half-brigades are severely censured by Napoleon in person for\\r\\ntheir cowardice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Once more I breathe freely._\"--Thrice had Napoleon been foiled, as\\r\\nmuch by the weather and his shoeless soldiers as by numbers (40,000\\r\\nAustrians to his 28,000), and his position was well-nigh hopeless on\\r\\nNovember 14th. He trusts Verona to 3000 men, and the blockade of\\r\\nMantua to Kilmaine, and the defence of Rivoli to Vaubois--the weakest\\r\\nlink in the chain--and determines to manoeuvre by the Lower Adige upon\\r\\nthe Austrian communications. He gets forty-eight hours\\' start, and\\r\\nwins Arcola; in 1814 he deserved equal success, but bad luck and\\r\\ntreachery turned the scale. The battle of Arcola lasted seventy-two\\r\\nhours, and for forty-eight hours was in favour of the Austrians.\\r\\nPending the arrival of the promised reinforcements, the battle was\\r\\nbought too dear, and weakened Bonaparte more than the Austrians, who\\r\\nreceived new troops almost daily. He replaced Vaubois by Joubert.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 18.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The 29th._\"--But he is at Milan from November 27th to December 16th.\\r\\nMost people know, from some print or other, the picture by Gros of\\r\\nBonaparte, flag in hand, leading his men across the murderous bridge\\r\\nof Arcola. It was during this visit to Milan that his portrait was\\r\\ntaken, and Lavalette has preserved for us the domestic rather than the\\r\\ndignified manner of the sitting accorded. He refused to give a fixed\\r\\ntime, and the artist was in despair, until Josephine came to his aid\\r\\nby taking her husband on her knees every morning after breakfast, and\\r\\nkeeping him there a short time. Lavalette assisted at three of these\\r\\nsittings--apparently to remove the bashful embarrassment of the young\\r\\npainter. St. Amand suggests that Gros taking the portrait of Bonaparte\\r\\nat Milan, just after Arcola, would, especially under such novel\\r\\nconditions, prove a fitting theme for our artists to-day! From\\r\\nDecember 16th to 21st Bonaparte is at Verona, whence he returns to\\r\\nMilan. There is perhaps a veiled innuendo in Barras\\' letter of\\r\\nDecember 30th. Clarke had advised the Directory that Alvinzi was\\r\\nplanning an attack, which Barras mentions, but adds: \"Your return to\\r\\nMilan shows that you consider another attack in favour of Wurmser\\r\\nunlikely, or, at least, not imminent.\" He is at Milan till January\\r\\n7th, whence he goes to Bologna, the city which, he says, \"of all the\\r\\nItalian cities has constantly shown the greatest energy and the most\\r\\nconsiderable share of real information.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 20.\\r\\n\\r\\n_General Brune._--This incident fixes the date of this letter to be 23\\r\\n_Nivose_ (January 12), and not 23 _Messidor_ (July 11), as hitherto\\r\\npublished in the French editions of this letter. On January 12, 1797,\\r\\nhe wrote General Clarke from Verona (No. 1375 of the _Correspondence_)\\r\\nalmost an exact duplicate of this letter--a very rare coincidence in\\r\\nthe epistles of Napoleon. \"Scarcely set out from Roverbella, I learnt\\r\\nthat the enemy had appeared at Verona. Massena made his dispositions,\\r\\nwhich have been very successful; we have made 600 prisoners, and we\\r\\nhave taken three pieces of cannon. General Brune has had seven bullets\\r\\nin his clothes, without having been touched by one of them; this is\\r\\nwhat it is to be lucky. We have had only ten men killed, and a hundred\\r\\nwounded.\" Bonaparte had left Bologna on January 10, reaching Verona\\r\\n_via_ Roverbella on the 12th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 21.\\r\\n\\r\\n_February 3rd._--\"_I wrote you this morning._\"--This and probably\\r\\nother letters describing Rivoli, La Favorite, and the imminent fall\\r\\nof Mantua, are missing. In summing up the campaign Thiers declares\\r\\nthat in ten months 55,000 French (all told, including reinforcements)\\r\\nhad beaten more than 200,000 Austrians, taken 80,000 of them\\r\\nprisoners, killed and wounded 20,000. They had fought twelve pitched\\r\\nbattles, and sixty actions. These figures are probably as much above\\r\\nthe mark as those of Napoleon\\'s detractors are below it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne does not know which to admire most, Bonaparte\\'s absence from\\r\\nMarshal Wurmser\\'s humiliation, or his abstention from entering Rome as\\r\\na conqueror. The first was the act of a perfect gentleman, worthy of\\r\\nthe best traditions of chivalry, the second was the very quintessence\\r\\nof far-seeing sagacity, not \"baulking the end half-won, for an instant\\r\\ndole of praise.\" As he told Mdme. de Remusat at Passeriano, \"I\\r\\nconquered the Pope better by not going to Rome than if I had burnt his\\r\\ncapital.\" Scott has compared his treatment of Wurmser to that of the\\r\\nBlack Prince with his royal prisoner, King John of France. Wurmser was\\r\\nan Alsatian on the list of _emigres_, and Bonaparte gave the Marshal\\r\\nhis life by sending him back to Austria, a fact which Wurmser requited\\r\\nby warning Bonaparte of a conspiracy to poison him[49] in Romagna,\\r\\nwhich Napoleon thinks would otherwise have been successful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 24.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Perhaps I shall make peace with the Pope._\"--On February 12th the\\r\\nPope had written to \"his dear son, General Bonaparte,\" to depute\\r\\nplenipotentiaries for a peace, and ends by assuring him \"of our\\r\\nhighest esteem,\" and concluding with the paternal apostolic\\r\\nbenediction. Meanwhile Napoleon, instead of sacking Faenza, has just\\r\\ninvoked the monks and priests to follow the precepts of the Gospel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 25.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The unlimited power you hold over me._\"--There seems no question\\r\\nthat during the Italian campaigns he was absolutely faithful to\\r\\nJosephine, although there was scarcely a beauty in Milan who did not\\r\\naspire to please him and to conquer him. In his fidelity there was,\\r\\nsays St. Amand, much love and a little calculation. As Napoleon has\\r\\nsaid himself, his position was delicate in the extreme; he commanded\\r\\nold generals; every one of his movements was jealously watched; his\\r\\ncircumspection was extreme. His fortune lay in his wisdom. He would\\r\\nhave to forget himself for one hour, and how many of his victories\\r\\ndepended upon no more! The celebrated singer, La Grassini, who had all\\r\\nItaly at her feet, cared only for the young general who would not at\\r\\nthat time vouchsafe her a glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [45] Murat, says Marmont, who hated him, was the culprit here.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [46] J. H. Rose in _Eng. Hist. Review_, January 1899.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [47] See Essay by J. H. Rose in _Eng. Hist. Review_, January 1899.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [48] With fevers caught in the rice-swamps of Lombardy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [49] With aqua tofana, says Marmont.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES C\\r\\n\\r\\n_THE CAMPAIGN OF MARENGO_, 1800\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElected to the joint consulate by the events of the 18th _Brumaire_\\r\\n(November 9), 1799, Napoleon spent the first Christmas Day after his\\r\\nreturn from Egypt in writing personal letters to the King of England\\r\\nand Emperor of Austria, with a view to peace. He asks King George how\\r\\nit is that the two most enlightened nations of Europe do not realise\\r\\nthat peace is the chief need as well as the chief glory ... and\\r\\nconcludes by asserting that the fate of all civilised nations is bound\\r\\nup in the conclusion of a war \"which embraces the entire world.\" His\\r\\nefforts fail in both cases. On December 27th he makes the _Moniteur_\\r\\nthe sole official journal. On February 7th, 1800, he orders ten days\\'\\r\\nmilitary mourning for the death of Washington--that \"great man who,\\r\\nlike the French, had fought for equality and liberty.\" On April 22nd\\r\\nhe urges Moreau to begin his campaign with the army of the Rhine, an\\r\\norder reiterated on April 24th through Carnot, again made Minister of\\r\\nWar. A diversion to save the army of Italy was now imperative. On May\\r\\n5th he congratulated Moreau on the battle of Stockach, but informs him\\r\\nthat Massena\\'s position is critical, shut up in Genoa, and with food\\r\\nonly till May 25th. He advises Massena the same day that he leaves\\r\\nParis that night to join the Army of Reserve, that the cherished\\r\\nchild of victory must hold out as long as possible, at least until May\\r\\n30th. At Geneva he met M. Necker. On May 14th he writes General\\r\\nMortier, commandant of Paris, to keep that city quiet, as he will have\\r\\nstill to be away a few days longer, which he trusts \"will not be\\r\\nindifferent to M. de Melas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter was written from Ivrea, May 29th, 1800. On the 30th\\r\\nNapoleon is at Vercelli, on June 1st at Novara, and on June 2nd in\\r\\nMilan. Eugene served under Murat at the passage of the Ticino, May\\r\\n31st.\\r\\n\\r\\n_M.\\'s_; probably \"Maman,\" _i.e._ his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Cherries._--This fruit had already tender associations. Las Cases\\r\\ntells us that when Napoleon was only sixteen he met at Valence\\r\\nMademoiselle du Colombier, who was not insensible to his merits. It\\r\\nwas the first love of both.... \"We were the most innocent creatures\\r\\nimaginable,\" the Emperor used to say; \"we contrived little meetings\\r\\ntogether. I well remember one which took place on a midsummer morning,\\r\\njust as daylight began to dawn. It will scarcely be believed that all\\r\\nour happiness consisted in eating cherries together\" (vol. i. 81,\\r\\n1836).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Milan._--He arrived here on June 2nd, and met with a great reception.\\r\\nIn his bulletin of June 5th we find him assisting at an improvised\\r\\nconcert. It ends, somewhat quaintly for a bulletin, as follows:\\r\\n\"Italian music has a charm ever new. The celebrated singers,\\r\\nBillington,[50] La Grassini, and Marchesi are expected at Milan. They\\r\\nsay they are about to start for Paris to give concerts there.\"\\r\\nAccording to M. Frederic Masson, this Paris visit masked ulterior\\r\\nmotives, and was arranged at a _dejeuner_ on the same day, where La\\r\\nGrassini, Napoleon, and Berthier breakfasted together. Henceforward to\\r\\nMarengo Napoleon spends every spare day listening to the marvellous\\r\\nsongstress, and as at Eylau, seven years later, runs great risks by\\r\\nadmitting Venus into the camp of Mars. At St. Helena he declares that\\r\\nfrom June 3rd to 8th he was busy \"receiving deputations, and showing\\r\\nhimself to people assembled from all parts of Lombardy to see their\\r\\nliberator.\" The Austrians had declared that he had died in Egypt. The\\r\\ndate of No. 4 should probably be June 9th, on which day the rain was\\r\\nvery heavy. He reached Stradella the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [50] On reaching London a few months later Mistress Billington was\\r\\n       engaged simultaneously by Drury Lane and Covent Garden, and\\r\\n       during the following year harvested L10,000 from these two\\r\\n       engagements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES D\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date is doubtless 27 _Messidor_ (July 16), and the fete alluded to\\r\\nthat of July 14. The following day Napoleon signed the Concordat with\\r\\nthe Pope, which paved the way for the restoration of the Roman\\r\\nCatholic religion in France (September 11).\\r\\n\\r\\n_The blister._--On July 7 he quaintly writes Talleyrand: \"They have\\r\\nput a second blister on my arm, which prevented me giving audience\\r\\nyesterday. Time of sickness is an opportune moment for coming to terms\\r\\nwith the priests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Some plants._--No trait in Josephine\\'s character is more characteristic\\r\\nthan her love of flowers--not the selfish love of a mere collector,[51]\\r\\nbut the bountiful joy of one who wishes to share her treasures.\\r\\nMalmaison had become the \"veritable Jardin des Plantes\" of the\\r\\nepoch,[52] far better than its Paris namesake in those days. The\\r\\nsplendid hothouses, constructed by M. Thibaut, had been modelled on\\r\\nthose of Kew, and enabled Josephine to collect exotics from every\\r\\nclime, and especially from her beloved Martinique. No jewel was so\\r\\nprecious to her as a rare and beautiful flower. The Minister of\\r\\nMarine never forgot to instruct the deep-sea captains to bring back\\r\\nfloral tributes from the far-off tropics. These often fell, together\\r\\nwith the ships, into the hands of the British sea-dogs, but the\\r\\nPrince Regent always had them sent on from London, and thus\\r\\nrendered, says Aubenas, \"the gallant homage of a courtly enemy to the\\r\\ncharming tastes and to the popularity already acquired by this\\r\\nuniversally beloved woman.\" Her curator, M. Aime Bonpland, was an\\r\\naccomplished naturalist, who had been with Humboldt in America, and\\r\\nbrought thence 6000 new plants. On his return in 1804 he was nominated\\r\\nby Josephine manager of the gardens of Malmaison and Navarre.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the splendid work, _Le Jardin de la Malmaison_, in three volumes,\\r\\nare plates, with descriptions of 184 plants, mostly new, collected\\r\\nthere from Egypt, Arabia, the United States, the Antilles, Mexico,\\r\\nMadeira, the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, the East Indies, New\\r\\nCaledonia, Australia, and China. To Josephine we owe the Camellia, and\\r\\nthe Catalpa, from the flora of Peru, whilst her maiden name (La\\r\\nPagerie) was perpetuated by Messrs. Pavon and Ruiz in the Lapageria.\\r\\n\\r\\n_If the weather is as bad._--As we shall see later, Bourrienne was\\r\\ninvaluable to Josephine\\'s court for his histrionic powers, and he\\r\\nseems to have been a prime favourite. On the present occasion he\\r\\nreceived the following \"Account of the Journey to Plombieres. To the\\r\\nInhabitants of Malmaison,\"--probably the work of Count Rapp, touched\\r\\nup by Hortense (Bourrienne\\'s _Napoleon_, vol. ii. 85. Bentley,\\r\\n1836):--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole party left Malmaison in tears, which brought on such\\r\\ndreadful headaches that all the amiable company were quite overcome by\\r\\nthe idea of the journey. Madame Bonaparte, mere, supported the\\r\\nfatigues of this memorable day with the greatest courage; but Madame\\r\\nBonaparte, consulesse, did not show any. The two young ladies who sat\\r\\nin the dormeuse, Mademoiselle Hortense and Madame Lavalette, were\\r\\nrival candidates for a bottle of Eau de Cologne; and every now and\\r\\nthen the amiable M. Rapp made the carriage stop for the comfort of his\\r\\npoor little sick heart, which overflowed with bile; in fact, he was\\r\\nobliged to take to bed on arriving at Epernay, while the rest of the\\r\\namiable party tried to drown their sorrows in champagne. The second\\r\\nday was more fortunate on the score of health and spirits, but\\r\\nprovisions were wanting, and great were the sufferings of the stomach.\\r\\nThe travellers lived on in the hope of a good supper at Toul, but\\r\\ndespair was at its height when on arriving there they found only a\\r\\nwretched inn, and nothing in it. We saw some odd-looking folks there,\\r\\nwhich indemnified us a little for spinach dressed with lamp-oil, and\\r\\nred asparagus fried with curdled milk. Who would not have been amused\\r\\nto see the Malmaison gourmands seated at a table so shockingly\\r\\nserved!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In no record of history is there to be found a day passed in distress\\r\\nso dreadful as that on which we arrived at Plombieres. On departing\\r\\nfrom Toul we intended to breakfast at Nancy, for every stomach had\\r\\nbeen empty for two days, but the civil and military authorities came\\r\\nout to meet us, and prevented us from executing our plan. We continued\\r\\nour route, wasting away, so that you might see us growing thinner\\r\\nevery moment. To complete our misfortune, the dormeuse, which seemed\\r\\nto have taken a fancy to embark on the Moselle for Metz, barely\\r\\nescaped an overturn. But at Plombieres we have been well compensated\\r\\nfor this unlucky journey, for on our arrival we were received with all\\r\\nkinds of rejoicings. The town was illuminated, the cannon fired, and\\r\\nthe faces of handsome women at all the windows gave us reason to hope\\r\\nthat we shall bear our absence from Malmaison with the less regret.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the exception of some anecdotes, which we reserve for chit-chat\\r\\non our return, you have here a correct account of our journey, which\\r\\nwe, the undersigned, hereby certify.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"JOSEPHINE BONAPARTE.\\r\\n  BEAUHARNAIS LAVALETTE.\\r\\n  HORTENSE BEAUHARNAIS.\\r\\n  RAPP.\\r\\n  BONAPARTE, MERE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The company ask pardon for the blots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  _\"21 Messidor (July 10)._\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is requested that the person who receives this journal will show\\r\\nit to all who take an interest in the fair travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time Hortense was madly in love with Napoleon\\'s favourite\\r\\ngeneral, Duroc, who, however, loved his master more, and preferred not\\r\\nto interfere with his projects, especially as a marriage with Hortense\\r\\nwould mean separation from Napoleon. Hortense and Bourrienne were both\\r\\nexcellent billiard players, and the latter used this opportunity to\\r\\ncarry letters from Hortense to her lukewarm lover.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Malmaison, without you, is too dreary._--Although Madame la Grassini\\r\\nhad been specially summoned to sing at the Fete de la Concorde the day\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the third pilgrimage Josephine has made, under the doctor\\'s\\r\\norders, to Plombieres; but the longed-for heir will have to be sought\\r\\nfor elsewhere, by fair means or foul. Lucien, who as Spanish\\r\\nAmbassador had vainly spent the previous year in arranging the divorce\\r\\nand remarriage of Napoleon to a daughter of the King of Spain,\\r\\nsuggests adultery at Plombieres, or a \"warming-pan conspiracy,\" as the\\r\\nlast alternatives.[53] Josephine complains to Napoleon of his\\r\\nbrother\\'s \"poisonous\" suggestions, and Lucien is again disgraced. In a\\r\\nfew months an heir is found in Hortense\\'s first-born, Napoleon\\r\\nCharles, born October 10.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The fat Eugene_ had come partly to be near his sister in her mother\\'s\\r\\nabsence, and partly to receive his colonelcy. Josephine is wretched to\\r\\nbe absent, and writes to Hortense (June 16):--\"I am utterly wretched,\\r\\nmy dear Hortense, to be separated from you, and my mind is as sick as\\r\\nmy body. I feel that I was not born, my dear child, for so much\\r\\ngrandeur.... By now Eugene should be with you; that thought consoles\\r\\nme.\" Aubenas has found in the Tascher archives a charming letter from\\r\\nJosephine to her mother in Martinique, announcing how soon she may\\r\\nhope to find herself a great-grandmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Your letter has come._--Possibly the one to Hortense quoted above, as\\r\\nJosephine was not fond of writing many letters.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Injured whilst shooting a boar._--Constant was not aware of this\\r\\noccurrence, and was therefore somewhat incredulous of Las Cases\\r\\n(vol. i. 289). The account in the \"Memorial of St. Helena\" is as\\r\\nfollows:--\"Another time, while hunting the wild boar at Marly, all his\\r\\nsuite were put to flight; it was like the rout of an army. The\\r\\nEmperor, with Soult and Berthier,[54] maintained their ground against\\r\\nthree enormous boars. \\'We killed all three, but I received a hurt\\r\\nfrom my adversary, and nearly lost this finger,\\' said the Emperor,\\r\\npointing to the third finger of his left hand, which indeed bore the\\r\\nmark of a severe wound. \\'But the most laughable circumstance of all\\r\\nwas to see the multitude of men, surrounded by their dogs, screening\\r\\nthemselves behind the three heroes, and calling out lustily \"Save the\\r\\nEmperor![55] save the Emperor!\" while not one advanced to my\\r\\nassistance\\'\" (vol. ii. 202. Colburn, 1836).\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The Barber of Seville._\"--This was their best piece, and spectators\\r\\n(except Lucien) agree that in it the little theatre at Malmaison and\\r\\nits actors were unsurpassed in Paris. Bourrienne as Bartholo, Hortense\\r\\nas Rosina, carried off the palm. According to the Duchesse d\\'Abrantes,\\r\\nWednesday was the usual day of representation, when the First Consul\\r\\nwas wont to ask forty persons to dinner, and a hundred and fifty for\\r\\nthe evening. As the Duchess had reason to know, Bonaparte was the\\r\\nseverest of critics. \"Lauriston made a noble lover,\" says the\\r\\nDuchess--\"rather heavy\" being Bourrienne\\'s more professional comment.\\r\\nEugene, says Meneval, excelled in footman\\'s parts.[56] Michot, from\\r\\nthe Theatre Francais, was stage manager; and Bonaparte provided what\\r\\nConstant has called \"the Malmaison Troupe,\" with their dresses and a\\r\\ncollection of dramas. He was always spurring them on to more ambitious\\r\\nflights, and by complimenting Bourrienne on his prodigious memory,\\r\\nwould stimulate him to learn the longest parts. Lucien, who refused to\\r\\nact, declares that Bonaparte quoted the saying of Louis XVI.\\r\\nconcerning Marie Antoinette and her company, that the performances\\r\\n\"were royally badly played.\" Junot, however, even in these days played\\r\\nthe part of a drunkard only too well (Jung, vol. ii. 256).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Sevres Manufactory._--After his visit, he wrote Duroc: \"This\\r\\nmorning I gave, in the form of gratuity, a week\\'s wages to the workmen\\r\\nof the Sevres manufactory. Have the amount given to the director. It\\r\\nshould not exceed a thousand ecus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Your lover, who is tired of being alone._--So much so that he got up\\r\\nat five o\\'clock in the morning to read his letters in a young bride\\'s\\r\\nbed-chamber. The story is brightly told by the lady in question,\\r\\nMadame d\\'Abrantes (vol. ii. ch. 19). A few days before the Marly hunt,\\r\\nmentioned in No. 3, the young wife of seventeen, whom Bonaparte had\\r\\nknown from infancy, and whose mother (Madame Permon) he had wished to\\r\\nmarry, found the First Consul seated by her bedside with a thick\\r\\npacket of letters, which he was carefully opening and making marginal\\r\\nnotes upon. At six he went off singing, pinching the lady\\'s foot\\r\\nthrough the bed-clothes as he went. The next day the same thing\\r\\nhappened, and the third day she locked herself in, and prevented her\\r\\nmaid from finding the key. In vain--the unwelcome visitor fetched a\\r\\nmaster-key. As a last resource, she wheedled her husband, General\\r\\nJunot, into breaking orders and spending the night with her; and the\\r\\nnext day (June 22) Bonaparte came in to proclaim the hunting morning,\\r\\nbut by her side found his old comrade of Toulon, fast asleep. The\\r\\nlatter dreamily but good-humouredly asked, \"Why, General, what are you\\r\\ndoing in a lady\\'s chamber at this hour?\" and the former replied, \"I\\r\\ncame to awake Madame Junot for the chase, but I find her provided with\\r\\nan alarum still earlier than myself. I might scold, for you are\\r\\ncontraband here, M. Junot.\" He then withdrew, after offering Junot a\\r\\nhorse for the hunt. The husband jumped up, exclaiming, \"Faith! that is\\r\\nan amiable man! What goodness! Instead of scolding, instead of sending\\r\\nme sneaking back to my duty in Paris! Confess, my Laura, that he is\\r\\nnot only an admirable being, but above the sphere of human nature.\"\\r\\nLaura, however, was still dubious. Later in the day she was taken to\\r\\ntask by the First Consul, who was astounded when she told him that his\\r\\naction might compromise her. \"I shall never forget,\" she says,\\r\\n\"Napoleon\\'s expression of countenance at this moment; it displayed a\\r\\nrapid succession of emotions, none of them evil.\" Josephine heard of\\r\\nthe affair, and was jealous for some little time to come.\\r\\n\\r\\n_General Ney._--Bonaparte had instructed Josephine to find him a nice\\r\\nwife, and she had chosen Mlle. Aglae-Louise Auguie, the intimate\\r\\nfriend and schoolfellow of Hortense, and daughter of a former\\r\\nReceveur-General des Finances. To the latter Ney goes fortified with a\\r\\ncharming letter from Josephine, dated May 30--the month which the\\r\\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_ has erroneously given for that of the\\r\\nmarriage, which seems to have taken place at the end of July\\r\\n(_Biographie Universelle, Michaud_, vol. xxx.). Napoleon (who stood\\r\\ngodfather to all the children of his generals) and Hortense were\\r\\nsponsors for the firstborn of this union, Napoleon Joseph, born May 8,\\r\\n1803. The Duchess d\\'Abrantes describes her first meeting with Madame\\r\\nNey at the Boulogne fete of August 15, 1802. Her simplicity and\\r\\ntimidity \"were the more attractive inasmuch as they formed a contrast\\r\\nto most of the ladies by whom she was surrounded at the court of\\r\\nFrance.... The softness and benevolence of Madame Ney\\'s smile,\\r\\ntogether with the intelligent expression of her large dark eyes,\\r\\nrendered her a very beautiful woman, and her lively manners and\\r\\naccomplishments enhanced her personal graces\" (vol. iii. 31). The\\r\\nbrave way in which she bore her husband\\'s execution won the admiration\\r\\nof Napoleon, who at St. Helena coupled her with Mdme. de Lavalette and\\r\\nMdme. Labedoyere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [51] She was, however, no mere amateur, and knew, says Mlle.\\r\\n       d\\'Avrillon, the names of all her plants, the family to which\\r\\n       they belonged, their native soil, and special properties.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [52] _Rueil, le chateau de Richelieu et la Malmaison_, by Jacquin and\\r\\n       Duesberg, p. 130; in Aubenas\\' _Josephine_, vol. i.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [53] Lucien declares that Napoleon said to his wife, in his presence\\r\\n       and that of Joseph, \"Imitate Livia, and you will find me\\r\\n       Augustus.\"--(Jung, vol. ii. 206.) Lucien evidently suspects an\\r\\n       occult sinister allusion here, but Napoleon is only alluding to\\r\\n       the succession devolving on the first child of their joint\\r\\n       families. Lucien refused Hortense, but Louis was more amenable\\r\\n       to his brother\\'s wishes. On her triumphal entry into Muehlberg\\r\\n       (November 1805), the Empress reads on a column a hundred feet\\r\\n       high--\"Josephinae, Galliarum Augustae.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [54] Made Grand Huntsman in 1804.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [55] An anachronism; he was at this time First Consul.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [56] An euphuistic way of saying he could not learn longer ones. In\\r\\n       war time Napoleon had to insist on Eugene keeping his letters\\r\\n       with him and constantly re-reading them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES E\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Madame._--Napoleon became Emperor on May 18th, and this was the first\\r\\nletter to his wife since Imperial etiquette had become _de rigueur_,\\r\\nand the first letter to Josephine signed Napoleon. Meneval gives a\\r\\nsomewhat amusing description of the fine gradations of instructions he\\r\\nreceived on this head from his master. This would seem to be a reason\\r\\nfor this uncommon form of salutation; but, _per contra_, Las Cases\\r\\n(vol. i. 276) mentions some so-called letters beginning _Madame et\\r\\nchere epouse_, which Napoleon declares to be spurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Pont de Bricques_, a little village about a mile from Boulogne. On\\r\\nhis first visit to the latter he was met by a deputation of farmers,\\r\\nof whom one read out the following address: \"General, here we are,\\r\\ntwenty farmers, and we offer you a score of big, sturdy lads, who are,\\r\\nand always shall be, at your service. Take them along with you,\\r\\nGeneral; they will help you to give England a good thrashing. As for\\r\\nourselves, we have another duty to fulfil: with our arms we will till\\r\\nthe ground, so that bread be not wanting to the brave fellows who are\\r\\ndestined to destroy the English.\" Napoleon thanked the honest yeomen,\\r\\nand determined to make the only habitable dwelling there his\\r\\nheadquarters. The place is called from the foundations of bricks found\\r\\nthere--the remains of one of Caesar\\'s camps.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The wind having considerably freshened._--Constant tells a good story\\r\\nof the Emperor\\'s obstinacy, but also of his bravery, a few days later.\\r\\nNapoleon had ordered a review of his ships, which Admiral Bruix had\\r\\nignored, seeing a storm imminent. Napoleon sends off Bruix to Holland\\r\\nin disgrace, and orders the review to take place; but when, amid the\\r\\nwild storm, he sees \"more than twenty gunboats run aground,\" and no\\r\\nsuccour vouchsafed to the drowning men, he springs into the nearest\\r\\nlifeboat, crying, \"We must save them somehow.\" A wave breaks over the\\r\\nboat; he is drenched and nearly carried overboard, losing the hat he\\r\\nhad worn at Marengo. Such pluck begets enthusiasm; but, in spite of\\r\\nall they could do, two hundred lives were lost. This is Constant\\'s\\r\\nversion; probably his loss is exaggerated. The Emperor, writing\\r\\nTalleyrand on August 1st, speaks only of three or four ships lost, and\\r\\n\"une quinzaine d\\'hommes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The waters._--Mlle. d\\'Avrillon describes them and their effect--the\\r\\nsulphur baths giving erysipelas to people in poor health. Corvisart\\r\\nhad accompanied the Empress, to superintend their effect, which was as\\r\\nusual nil.\\r\\n\\r\\n_All the vexations._--Constant (vol. i. 230, &c., 1896) is of use to\\r\\nexplain what these were--having obtained possession of a diary of the\\r\\ntour by one of Josephine\\'s ladies-in-waiting, which had fallen into\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s hands. In the first place, the roads (where there were\\r\\nany[57]) were frightful, especially in the Ardennes forest, and the\\r\\ndiary for August 1st concludes by stating \"that some of the carriages\\r\\nwere so battered that they had to be bound together with ropes. One\\r\\nought not to expect women to travel about like a lot of dragoons.\" The\\r\\nwriter of the diary, however, preferred to stay in the carriage, and\\r\\nlet Josephine and the rest get wet feet, thinking the risk she ran the\\r\\nleast. Another vexation to Josephine was the published report of her\\r\\ngift to the Mayoress of Rheims of a malachite medallion set in\\r\\nbrilliants, and of her saying as she did so, \"It is the colour of\\r\\nHope.\" Although she had really used this expression, it was the last\\r\\nthing she would like to see in print, taking into consideration the\\r\\nreason for her yearly peregrinations to Plombieres, and now to Aix,\\r\\nand their invariable inefficiency. Under the date August 14th, the\\r\\nwriter of the diary gives a severe criticism of Josephine. \"She is\\r\\nexactly like a ten-year-old child--good-natured, frivolous,\\r\\nimpressionable; in tears at one moment, and comforted the next.... She\\r\\nhas just wit enough not to be an utter idiot. Ignorant--as are most\\r\\nCreoles--she has learned nothing, or next to nothing, except by\\r\\nconversation; but, having passed her life in good society, she has got\\r\\ngood manners, grace, and a mastery of that sort of jargon which, in\\r\\nsociety, sometimes passes for wit. Social events constitute the canvas\\r\\nwhich she embroiders, which she arranges, and which give her a subject\\r\\nfor conversation. She is witty for quite a whole quarter of an hour\\r\\nevery day.... Her diffidence is charming ... her temper very sweet and\\r\\neven; it is impossible not to be fond of her. I fear that ... this\\r\\nneed of unbosoming, of communicating all her thoughts and impressions,\\r\\nof telling all that passes between herself and the Emperor, keeps the\\r\\nlatter from taking her into his confidence.... She told me this\\r\\nmorning that, during all the years she had spent with him, never once\\r\\nhad she seen him let himself go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene has started for Blois_, where he became the head of the\\r\\nelectoral college of Loir et Cher, having just been made Colonel-General\\r\\nof the Chasseurs by Napoleon. The Beauharnais family were originally\\r\\nnatives of Blois.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Aix-la-Chapelle._--In this, the first Imperial pilgrimage to take the\\r\\nwaters, great preparations had been made, forty-seven horses bought at\\r\\nan average cost of L60 apiece; and eight carriages, which are not dear\\r\\nat L1000 for the lot, with L400 additional for harness and fittings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Aix they had fox-hunting and hare-coursing so called, but probably\\r\\nthe final tragedy was consummated with a gun. Lord Rosebery reminds us\\r\\nthat at St. Helena the Emperor actually shot a cow! They explored coal\\r\\nmines, and examined all the local manufactories, including the relics\\r\\nof Charlemagne--of which great warrior and statesman Josephine refused\\r\\nan arm, as having a still more puissant one ever at hand for her\\r\\nprotection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tidings come that the Emperor will arrive on September 2, and\\r\\nprolong their stay from Paris, there is general lamentation among\\r\\nJosephine\\'s womenkind, especially on the part of that perennial wet\\r\\nblanket and busybody, Madame de Larochefoucauld, who will make herself\\r\\na still greater nuisance at Mayence two years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_During the past week._--As a matter of fact he only reached Ostend on\\r\\nApril 12th from Boulogne, having left Dunkirk on the 11th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The day after to-morrow._--This fete was the distribution of the\\r\\nLegion of Honour at Boulogne and a review of 80,000 men. The\\r\\ndecorations were enshrined in the helmet of Bertrand du Guesclin,\\r\\nwhich in its turn was supported on the shield of the Chevalier\\r\\nBayard.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hortense_ arrived at Boulogne, with her son, and the Prince and\\r\\nPrincess Murat, a few days later, and saw the Emperor. Josephine\\r\\nreceived a letter from Hortense soon after Napoleon joined her\\r\\n(September 2nd), to which she replied on September 8th. \"The Emperor\\r\\nhas read your letter; he has been rather vexed not to hear from you\\r\\noccasionally. He would not doubt your kind heart if he knew it as well\\r\\nas I, but appearances are against you. Since he can think you are\\r\\nneglecting him, lose no time in repairing the wrongs which are not\\r\\nreal,\" for \"Bonaparte loves you like his own child, which adds much to\\r\\nmy affection for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am very well satisfied ... with the flotillas._--The descent upon\\r\\nEngland was to have taken place in September, when the death of\\r\\nAdmiral Latouche-Treville at Toulon, August 19th, altered all\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s plans. Just about this time also _Fulton_ submitted his\\r\\nsteamship invention to Bonaparte. The latter, however, had recently\\r\\nbeen heavily mulcted in other valueless discoveries, and refers Fulton\\r\\nto the savants of the Institute, who report it chimerical and\\r\\nimpracticable. The fate of England probably lay in the balance at this\\r\\nmoment, more than in 1588 or 1798.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon and Josephine leave Aix for Cologne on September 12, and it\\r\\nis now the ladies\\' turn to institute a hunt--the \"real chamois hunt\";\\r\\nfor each country inn swarms with this pestilence that walketh in\\r\\ndarkness, and which, alas! is no respecter of persons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo points are noteworthy in this letter--(1) that like No. 1 of this\\r\\nseries (see note thereto) it commences _Madame and dear Wife_; and (2)\\r\\nit is signed Bonaparte and not Napoleon, which somewhat militates\\r\\nagainst its authenticity.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Arras, August 29th._--Early on this day he had been at St. Cloud. On\\r\\nthe 30th he writes Cambaceres from Arras that he is \"satisfied with\\r\\nthe spirit of this department.\" On the same day he writes thence to\\r\\nthe King of Prussia and Fouche. To his Minister of Police he writes:\\r\\n\"That detestable journal, _Le Citoyen francais_, seems only to wish to\\r\\nwallow in blood. For eight days running we have been entertained with\\r\\nnothing but the Saint Bartholomew. Who on earth is the editor\\r\\n(_redacteur_) of this paper? With what gusto this wretch relishes the\\r\\ncrimes and misfortunes of our fathers! My intention is that you should\\r\\nput a stop to it. Have the editor (_directeur_) of this paper changed,\\r\\nor suppress it.\" On Friday he is at Mons (writing interesting letters\\r\\nrespecting the removal of church ruins), and reaches his wife on the\\r\\nSunday (September 2nd) as his letter foreshadowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am rather impatient to see you._--The past few months had been an\\r\\nanxious time for Josephine. Talleyrand (who, having insulted her in\\r\\n1799, thought her his enemy) was scheming for her divorce, and wished\\r\\nNapoleon to marry the Princess Wilhelmina of Baden, and thus cement an\\r\\nalliance with Bavaria and Russia (Constant, vol. i. 240). The\\r\\nBonaparte family were very anxious that Josephine should not be\\r\\ncrowned. Napoleon had too great a contempt for the weaknesses of\\r\\naverage human nature to expect much honesty from Talleyrand. But he\\r\\nwas not as yet case-hardened to ingratitude, and was always highly\\r\\nsensitive to caricature and hostile criticism. Talleyrand had been the\\r\\nmain cause of the death of the Duc d\\'Enghien, and was now trying to\\r\\nshow that he had wished to prevent it; but possibly the crowning\\r\\noffence was contained in a lady\\'s diary, that fell into the emperor\\'s\\r\\nhands, where Talleyrand is said to have called his master \"a regular\\r\\nlittle Nero\" in his system of espionage. The diary in question is in\\r\\nConstant\\'s \"Memoirs,\" vol. i., and this letter helps to fix the error\\r\\nin the dates, probably caused by confusion between the Revolutionary\\r\\nand Gregorian Calendars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_T._--This may be Talleyrand, whom Mdme. de Remusat in a letter to her\\r\\nhusband (September 21st) at Aix, hinted to be on bad terms with the\\r\\nEmperor--a fact confirmed and explained by Meneval. It may also have\\r\\nbeen Tallien, who returned to France in 1802, where he had been\\r\\ndivorced from his unfaithful wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n_B._--Doubtlessly Bourrienne, who was in disgrace with Napoleon, and\\r\\nwho was always trying to impose on Josephine\\'s good nature. No sooner\\r\\nhad Napoleon left for Boulogne on July 14th than his former secretary\\r\\ninflicts himself on the wife at Malmaison.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon joins Josephine at St. Cloud on or before October 13th, where\\r\\npreparations are already being made for the Coronation by the\\r\\nPope--the first ceremony of the kind for eight centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [57] The Emperor had himself planned the Itinerary, and had mistaken a\\r\\n       projected road for a completed one, between Rethel and Marche.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES F\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_To Josephine._--She was at Plombieres from August 2 to September 10,\\r\\nbut no letter is available for the period, neither to Hortense nor\\r\\nfrom Napoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Strasburg._--She is in the former Episcopal Palace, at the foot of\\r\\nthe cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Stuttgard._--He is driven over from Ludwigsburg on October 4th, and\\r\\nhears the German opera of \"Don Juan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am well placed._--On the same day Napoleon writes his brother\\r\\nJoseph that he has already won two great victories--(1) by having no\\r\\nsick or deserters, but many new conscripts; and (2) because the\\r\\nBadenese army and those of Bavaria and Wurtemberg had joined him, and\\r\\nall Germany well disposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Louisburg._--Ludwigsburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n_In a few days._--To Talleyrand he wrote from Strasburg on September\\r\\n27: \"Within a fortnight we shall see several things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_A new bride._--This letter, in the collection of his Correspondence\\r\\nordered by Napoleon III., concludes at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Electress._--The Princess Charlotte-Auguste-Mathilde (1766-1828),\\r\\ndaughter of George III., our Princess Royal, who married Frederick I.\\r\\nNapoleon says she is \"not well treated by the Elector, to whom,\\r\\nnevertheless, she seems much attached\" (Brotonne, No. 111). She was\\r\\nequally pleased with Napoleon, and wrote home how astonished she was\\r\\nto find him so polite and agreeable a person.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I have assisted at a marriage._--The bride was the Princess of\\r\\nSaxe-Hildburghhausen, who was marrying the second son of the Elector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten at Augsburg. On October 15th he reaches the abbey of\\r\\nElchingen, which is situated on a height, from whence a wide view is\\r\\nobtained, and establishes his headquarters there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Spent the whole of to-day indoors._--This is also mentioned in his\\r\\nSeventh Bulletin (dated the same day), which adds, \"But repose is not\\r\\ncompatible with the direction of this immense army.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Vicenza._--Massena did not, however, reach this place till November\\r\\n3rd. The French editions have _Vienna_, but _Vicenza_ is evidently\\r\\nmeant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is still at Elchingen, but at Augsburg the next day. On the 21st he\\r\\nissues a decree to his army that Vendemiaire,[58] of which this was\\r\\nthe last day but one, should be counted as a campaign for pensions and\\r\\nmilitary services.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Elchingen._--Meneval speaks of this village \"rising in an amphitheatre\\r\\nabove the Danube, surrounded by walled gardens, and houses rising one\\r\\nabove the other.\" From it Napoleon saw the city of Ulm below,\\r\\ncommanded by his cannon. Marshal Ney won his title of Duke of Elchingen\\r\\nby capturing it on October 14th, and fully deserved it. The Emperor\\r\\nused to leave the abbey every morning to go to the camp before Ulm,\\r\\nwhere he used to spend the day, and sometimes the night. The rain\\r\\nwas so heavy that, until a plank was found, Napoleon sat in a tent\\r\\nwith his feet in water (Savary, vol. ii. 196).\\r\\n\\r\\n_Such a catastrophe._--At Ulm General Mack, with eight field-marshals,\\r\\nseven lieutenant-generals, and 33,000 men surrender. Napoleon had\\r\\ndespised Mack even in 1800, when he told Bourrienne at Malmaison,\\r\\n\"Mack is a man of the lowest mediocrity I ever saw in my life; he is\\r\\nfull of self-sufficiency and conceit, and believes himself equal to\\r\\nanything. He has no talent. I should like to see him some day opposed\\r\\nto one of our good generals; we should then see fine work. He is a\\r\\nboaster, and that is all. He is really one of the most silly men\\r\\nexisting, and besides all that, he is unlucky\" (vol. i. 304). Napoleon\\r\\nstipulated for Mack\\'s life in one of the articles of the Treaty of\\r\\nPresburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Munich._--Napoleon arrived here on October 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lemarois._--A trusty aide-de-camp, who had witnessed Napoleon\\'s civil\\r\\nmarriage in March 1796, at 10 P.M.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I was grieved._--They had no news from October 12th to 21st in Paris,\\r\\nwhere they learnt daily that Strasburg was in the same predicament.\\r\\nMdme. de Remusat, at Paris, was equally anxious, and such women, in\\r\\nthe Emperor\\'s absence, tended by their presence or even by their\\r\\ncorrespondence to increase the alarms of Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Amuse yourself._--M. Masson (_Josephine, Imperatrice et Reine_, p.\\r\\n424) has an interesting note of how she used to attend lodge at the\\r\\nOrient in Strasburg, to preside at a \"loge d\\'adoption sous la\\r\\ndirection de Madame de Dietrich, grand maitresse titulaire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Talleyrand has come._--He was urgently needed to help in the\\r\\ncorrespondence with the King of Prussia (concerning the French\\r\\nviolation of his Anspach territory), with whom Napoleon\\'s relations\\r\\nwere becoming more strained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\n_We are always in forests._--Baron Lejeune, with his artist\\'s eye,\\r\\ndescribes his impressions of the Amstetten forest as he travelled\\r\\nthrough it with Murat the following morning (November 4th). \"Those\\r\\nof us who came from the south of Europe had never before realised\\r\\nhow beautiful Nature can be in the winter. In this particular\\r\\ninstance everything was robed in the most gleaming attire; the\\r\\nsilvery rime softening the rich colours of the decaying oak leaves,\\r\\nand the sombre vegetation of the pines. The frozen drapery, combined\\r\\nwith the mist, in which everything was more or less enveloped, gave\\r\\na soft, mysterious charm to the surrounding objects, producing a\\r\\nmost beautiful picture. Lit up by the sunshine, thousands of long\\r\\nicicles, such as those which sometimes droop from our fountains and\\r\\nwater-wheels, hung like shining lustres from the trees. Never did\\r\\nball-room shine with so many diamonds; the long branches of the\\r\\noaks, pines, and other forest trees were weighed down by the\\r\\nmasses of hoar-frost, while the snow converted their summits into\\r\\nrounded roofs, forming beneath them grottoes resembling those of the\\r\\nPyrenean mountains, with their shining stalactites and graceful\\r\\ncolumns\" (vol. i. 24).\\r\\n\\r\\n_My enemies._--Later in the day Napoleon writes from Lambach to the\\r\\nEmperor of Austria a pacific letter, which contains the paragraph, \"My\\r\\nambition is wholly concentrated on the re-establishment of my commerce\\r\\nand of my marine, and England grievously opposes itself to both.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Lintz, the capital of Upper Austria, where Napoleon was\\r\\non the 4th.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon took up his abode at the palace of Schoenbrunn on the 14th,\\r\\nand proves his \"two-o\\'clock-in-the-morning courage\" by passing through\\r\\nVienna at that time the following morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n_They owe everything to you._--Aubenas quotes this, and remarks (vol.\\r\\nii. 326): \"No one had pride in France more than Napoleon, stronger\\r\\neven than his conviction of her superiority in the presence of other\\r\\ncontemporary sovereigns and courts. He wishes that in Germany, where\\r\\nshe will meet families with all the pride and sometimes all the\\r\\nhaughtiness of their ancestry, Josephine will not forget that she is\\r\\nEmpress of the French, superior to those who are about to receive her,\\r\\nand who owe full respect and homage to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 14.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Austerlitz._--Never was a victory more needful; but never was the\\r\\nEmperor more confident. Savary says that it would take a volume to\\r\\ncontain all that emanated from his mind during that twenty-four hours\\r\\n(December 1-2). Nor was it confined to military considerations.\\r\\nGeneral Segur describes how he spent his evening meal with his\\r\\nmarshals, discussing with Junot the last new tragedy (_Les Templiers_,\\r\\nby Raynouard), and from it to Racine, Corneille, and the fatalism of\\r\\nour ancestors.\\r\\n\\r\\n_December 2nd_ was a veritable Black Monday for the Coalition in\\r\\ngeneral, and for Russia in particular, where Monday is always looked\\r\\nupon as an unlucky day. Their forebodings increased when, on the eve\\r\\nof the battle, the Emperor Alexander was thrown from his horse\\r\\n(Czartoriski, vol. ii. 106).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 17.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A long time since I had news of you._--Josephine was always a bad\\r\\ncorrespondent, but at this juncture was reading that stilted but\\r\\nsensational romance--\"Caleb Williams;\" or hearing the \"Achilles\" of\\r\\nPaer, or the \"Romeo and Juliet\" of Zingarelli in the intervals of her\\r\\nimperial progress through Germany. M. Masson, not often too indulgent\\r\\nto Josephine, thinks her conduct excusable at this period--paying and\\r\\nreceiving visits, dressing and redressing, always in gala costume, and\\r\\nwithout a moment\\'s solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I await events._--A phrase usually attributed to Talleyrand in\\r\\n1815. However, the Treaty of Presburg was soon signed (December\\r\\n2nd), and the same day Napoleon met the Archduke Charles at\\r\\nStamersdorf, a meeting arranged from mutual esteem. Napoleon had\\r\\nan unswerving admiration for this past and future foe, and said to\\r\\nMadame d\\'Abrantes, \"That man has a soul, a golden heart.\"[59]\\r\\nNapoleon, however, did not wish to discuss politics, and only\\r\\narranged for an interview of two hours, \"one of which,\" he wrote\\r\\nTalleyrand, \"will be employed in dining, the other in talking war and\\r\\nin mutual protestations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_I, for my part, am sufficiently busy._--No part of Napoleon\\'s career\\r\\nis more wonderful than the way in which he conducts the affairs of\\r\\nFrance and of Europe from a hostile capital. This was his first\\r\\nexperience of the kind, and perhaps the easiest, although Prussian\\r\\ndiplomacy had needed very delicate and astute handling. But when\\r\\nNapoleon determined, without even consulting his wife, to cement\\r\\npolitical alliances by matrimonial ones with his and her relatives, he\\r\\nwas treading on somewhat new and difficult ground. First and foremost,\\r\\nhe wanted a princess for his ideal young man, Josephine\\'s son Eugene,\\r\\nand he preferred Auguste, the daughter of the King of Bavaria, to the\\r\\noffered Austrian Archduchess. But the young Hereditary Prince of Baden\\r\\nwas in love and accepted by his beautiful cousin Auguste; so, to\\r\\ncompensate him for his loss, the handsome and vivacious Stephanie\\r\\nBeauharnais, fresh from Madame Campan\\'s finishing touches, was sent\\r\\nfor. For his brother Jerome a bride is found by Napoleon in the\\r\\ndaughter of the King of Wurtemberg. Baden, Bavaria, and Wurtemberg\\r\\nwere too much indebted to France for the spoils they were getting from\\r\\nAustria to object, provided the ladies and their mammas were\\r\\nagreeable; but the conqueror of Austerlitz found this part the most\\r\\ndifficult, and had to be so attentive to the Queen of Bavaria that\\r\\nJosephine was jealous. However, all the matches came off, and still\\r\\nmore remarkable, all turned out happily, a fact which certainly\\r\\nredounds to Napoleon\\'s credit as a match-maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 31st, at 1.45 A.M., he entered Munich by torchlight and\\r\\nunder a triumphal arch. His chamberlain, M. de Thiard, assured him\\r\\nthat if he left Munich the marriage with Eugene would fall through,\\r\\nand he agrees to stay, although he declared that his absence, which\\r\\naccentuated the Bank crisis, is costing him 1,500,000 francs a day.\\r\\nThe marriage took place on January 14th, four days after Eugene\\r\\narrived at Munich and three days after that young Bayard had been\\r\\nbereft of his cherished moustache. Henceforth the bridegroom is called\\r\\n\"Mon fils\" in Napoleon\\'s correspondence, and in the contract of\\r\\nmarriage Napoleon-Eugene de France. The Emperor and Empress reached\\r\\nthe Tuileries on January 27th. The marriage of Stephanie was even more\\r\\ndifficult to manage, for, as St. Amand points out, the Prince of Baden\\r\\nhad for brothers-in-law the Emperor of Russia, the King of Sweden, and\\r\\nthe King of Bavaria--two of whom at least were friends of England.\\r\\nJosephine had once an uncle-in-law, the Count Beauharnais, whose wife\\r\\nFanny was a well-known literary character of the time, but of whom the\\r\\npoet Lebrun made the epigram--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Elle fait son visage, et ne fait pas ses vers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStephanie was the grand-daughter of this couple, and as Grand-Duchess\\r\\nof Baden was beloved and respected, and lived on until 1860.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [58] The first month of the Republican calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [59] Memoirs, vol. ii. 165.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES G\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon left St. Cloud with Josephine on September 25th, and had\\r\\nreached Mayence on the 28th, where his Foot Guard were awaiting him.\\r\\nHe left Mayence on October 1st, and reached Wuerzburg the next day,\\r\\nwhence this letter was written, just before starting for Bamberg.\\r\\nJosephine was installed in the Teutonic palace at Mayence.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Princess of Baden_, Stephanie Beauharnais. (For her marriage, see\\r\\nnote, end of Series F.)\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hortense_ was by no means happy with her husband at the best of\\r\\ntimes, and she cordially hated Holland. She was said to be very\\r\\nfrightened of Napoleon, but (like most people) could easily influence\\r\\nher mother. Napoleon\\'s letter to her of this date (October 5th) is\\r\\ncertainly not a severe one:--\"I have received yours of September 14th.\\r\\nI am sending to the Chief Justice in order to accord pardon to the\\r\\nindividual in whom you are interested. Your news always gives me\\r\\npleasure. I trust you will keep well, and never doubt my great\\r\\nfriendship for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Grand Duke_, _i.e._ of Wuerzburg. The castle where Napoleon\\r\\nwas staying seemed to him sufficiently strong to be armed and\\r\\nprovisioned, and he made a great depot in the city. \"Volumes,\" says\\r\\nMeneval, \"would not suffice to describe the multitude of his\\r\\nmilitary and administrative measures here, and the precautions which\\r\\nhe took against even the most improbable hazards of war.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Florence._--Probably September 1796, when Napoleon was hard pressed,\\r\\nand Josephine had to fetch a compass from Verona to regain Milan, and\\r\\nthus evade Wurmser\\'s troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Bamberg._--Arriving at Bamberg on the 6th, Napoleon issued a\\r\\nproclamation to his army which concluded--\"Let the Prussian army\\r\\nexperience the same fate that it experienced fourteen years ago. Let\\r\\nit learn that, if it is easy to acquire increase of territory and\\r\\npower by means of the friendship of the great people, their enmity,\\r\\nwhich can be provoked only by the abandonment of all spirit of wisdom\\r\\nand sense, is more terrible than the tempests of the ocean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene._--Napoleon wrote him on the 5th, and twice on the 7th, on\\r\\nwhich date we have _eighteen_ letters in the _Correspondence_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Her husband._--The Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden, to whom Napoleon\\r\\nhad written from Mayence on September 30th, accepting his services,\\r\\nand fixing the rendezvous at Bamberg for October 4th or 5th.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this day Napoleon invaded Prussian territory by entering Bayreuth,\\r\\nhaving preceded by one day the date of their ultimatum--a rhapsody of\\r\\ntwenty pages, which Napoleon in his First Bulletin compares to \"one of\\r\\nthose which the English Cabinet pay their literary men L500 per annum\\r\\nto write.\" It is in this Bulletin where he describes the Queen of\\r\\nPrussia (dressed as an Amazon, in the uniform of her regiment of\\r\\ndragoons, and writing twenty letters a day) to be like Armida in her\\r\\nfrenzy, setting fire to her own palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the Prussian army is already in a tight corner, with its\\r\\nback on the Rhine, which, as Napoleon says in his Third Bulletin\\r\\nwritten on this day, is \"_assez bizarre_, from which very important\\r\\nevents should ensue.\" On the previous day he concludes a letter to\\r\\nTalleyrand--\"One cannot conceive how the Duke of Brunswick, to whom\\r\\none allows some talent, can direct the operations of this army in so\\r\\nridiculous a manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Erfurt._--Here endless discussions, but, as Napoleon says in his\\r\\nbulletin of this day--\"Consternation is at Erfurt, ... but while they\\r\\ndeliberate, the French army is marching.... Still the wishes of the\\r\\nKing of Prussia have been executed; he wished that by October 8th the\\r\\nFrench army should have evacuated the territory of the Confederation\\r\\nwhich _has_ been evacuated, but in place of repassing the Rhine, it\\r\\nhas passed the Saal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_If she wants to see a battle._--_Queen Louise_, great-grandmother of\\r\\nthe present Emperor William, and in 1806 aged thirty. St. Amand says\\r\\nthat \"when she rode on horseback before her troops, with her helmet of\\r\\npolished steel, shaded by a plume, her gleaming golden cuirass, her\\r\\ntunic of cloth of silver, her red buskins with golden spurs,\" she\\r\\nresembled, as the bulletin said, one of the heroines of Tasso. She\\r\\nhated France, and especially Napoleon, as the child of the French\\r\\nRevolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I nearly captured him and the Queen._--They escaped only by an hour,\\r\\nNapoleon writes Berthier. Blucher aided their escape by telling a\\r\\nFrench General about an imaginary armistice, which the latter was\\r\\nseverely reprimanded by Napoleon for believing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo battle was more beautifully worked out than the battle of\\r\\nJena--Davoust performing specially well his move in the combinations\\r\\nby which the Prussian army was hopelessly entangled, as Mack at Ulm a\\r\\nyear before. Bernadotte alone, and as usual, gave cause for\\r\\ndissatisfaction. He had a personal hatred for his chief, caused by the\\r\\nknowledge that his wife (Desiree Clary) had never ceased to regret\\r\\nthat she had missed her opportunity of being the wife of Napoleon.\\r\\nBernadotte, therefore, was loth to give initial impetus to the\\r\\nvictories of the French Emperor, though, when success was no longer\\r\\ndoubtful, he would prove that it was not want of capacity but want of\\r\\nwill that had kept him back. He was the Talleyrand of the camp, and\\r\\nhad an equal aptitude for fishing in troubled waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I have bivouacked._--Whether the issue of a battle was decisive,\\r\\nor, as at Eylau, only partially so, Napoleon never shunned the\\r\\ndisagreeable part of battle--the tending of the wounded and the\\r\\nburial of the dead. Savary tells us that at Jena, as at Austerlitz,\\r\\nthe Emperor rode round the field of battle, alighting from his horse\\r\\nwith a little brandy flask (constantly refilled), putting his hand\\r\\nto each unconscious soldier\\'s breast, and when he found unexpected\\r\\nlife, giving way to a joy \"impossible to describe\" (vol. ii. 184).\\r\\nMeneval also speaks of his performing this \"pious duty, in the\\r\\nfulfilment of which nothing was allowed to stand in his way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Fatigues, bivouacs ... have made me fat._--The Austerlitz campaign\\r\\nhad the same effect. See a remarkable letter to Count Miot de Melito\\r\\non January 30th, 1806: \"The campaign I have just terminated, the\\r\\nmovement, the excitement have made me stout. I believe that if all the\\r\\nkings of Europe were to coalesce against me I should have a ridiculous\\r\\npaunch.\" And it was so!\\r\\n\\r\\n_The great M. Napoleon_, aged four, and the younger, aged two, are\\r\\nwith Hortense and their grandmother at Mayence, where a Court had\\r\\nassembled, including most of the wives of Napoleon\\'s generals, burning\\r\\nfor news. A look-out had been placed by the Empress some two miles on\\r\\nthe main-road beyond Mayence, whence sight of a courier was signalled\\r\\nin advance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Potsdam._--As a reward for Auerstadt, Napoleon orders Davoust and his\\r\\nfamous Third Corps to be the first to enter Berlin the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Berlin, where he is from October 28th to November 25th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_You do nothing but cry._--Josephine spent her evenings gauging\\r\\nfuturity with a card-pack, and although it announced Jena and\\r\\nAuerstadt before the messenger, it may possibly, thinks M. Masson,\\r\\nhave been less propitious for the future--and behind all was the\\r\\nsinister portion of the spae-wife\\'s prophecy still unfulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9A.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Madame Tallien_ had been in her time, especially in the years\\r\\n1795-99, one of the most beautiful and witty women in France. Madame\\r\\nd\\'Abrantes calls her the Venus of the Capitol; and Lucien Bonaparte\\r\\nspeaks of the court of the voluptuous Director, Barras, where the\\r\\nbeautiful Tallien was the veritable Calypso. The people, however,\\r\\ncould not forget her second husband, Tallien, from whom she was\\r\\ndivorced in 1802 (having had three children born while he was in\\r\\nEgypt, 1798-1802); and whilst they called Josephine \"Notre Dame des\\r\\nVictoires,\" they called Madame Tallien \"Notre Dame de Septembre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter was, however, celebrated both for her beauty and her\\r\\nintrigues;[60] and when, in 1799, Bonaparte seized supreme power the\\r\\nfair lady[61] invaded Barras in his bath to inform him of it; but\\r\\nfound her indolent Ulysses only capable of ejaculating, \"What can be\\r\\ndone? that man has taken us all in!\" Napoleon probably remembered\\r\\nthis, and may refer to her rather than to the Queen of Prussia in the\\r\\nnext letter, where he makes severe strictures on intriguing women.\\r\\nMoreover, Napoleon in his early campaigns had played a ridiculous part\\r\\nin some of Gillray\\'s most indecent cartoons, where Mmes. Tallien and\\r\\nJosephine took with Barras the leading roles; and as Madame Tallien\\r\\nwas not considered respectable in 1796, she was hardly a fit friend\\r\\nfor the Empress of the French ten years later. In the interval this\\r\\nlady, divorced a second time, had married the Prince de Chimay\\r\\n(Caraman). Napoleon knew also that she had been the mistress of\\r\\nOuvrard, the banker, who in his Spanish speculations a few months\\r\\nearlier had involved the Bank of France to the tune of four millions\\r\\nsterling, and forced Napoleon to make a premature peace after\\r\\nAusterlitz. The Emperor had returned at white heat to Paris, and\\r\\nwished he could build a gallows for Ouvrard high enough for him to be\\r\\non view throughout France. Madame Tallien\\'s own father, M. de\\r\\nCabarrus, was a French banker in Spain, and probably in close relation\\r\\nwith Ouvrard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The bad things I say about women._--Napoleon looked upon this as a\\r\\nwoman\\'s war, and his temper occasionally gets the mastery of him. No\\r\\nwar had ever been so distasteful to him or so personal. Prussia, whose\\r\\nalliance he had been courting for nearly ten years, was now worthless\\r\\nto him, and all because of petticoat government at Berlin. In the\\r\\nFifteenth Bulletin (dated Wittenburg, October 23rd) he states that\\r\\nthe Queen had accused her husband of cowardice in order to bring about\\r\\nthe war. But it is doubtless the Sixteenth Bulletin (dated Potsdam,\\r\\nOctober 25th) to which Josephine refers, and which refers to the oath\\r\\nof alliance of the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in the\\r\\ndeath chamber of Frederick the Great. \"It is from this moment that the\\r\\nQueen quitted the care of her domestic concerns and the serious\\r\\noccupations of the toilet in order to meddle with the affairs of\\r\\nState.\" He refers to a Berlin caricature of the scene which was at the\\r\\ntime in all the shops, \"exciting even the laughter of clodhoppers.\"\\r\\nThe handsome Emperor of Russia was portrayed, by his side the Queen,\\r\\nand on his other side the King of Prussia with his hand raised above\\r\\nthe tomb of the Great Frederick; the Queen herself, draped in a shawl\\r\\nnearly as the London engravings represent Lady Hamilton, pressing her\\r\\nhand on her heart, and apparently gazing upon the Emperor of Russia.\"\\r\\nIn the Eighteenth Bulletin (October 26th) it is said the Prussian\\r\\npeople did not want war, that a handful of women and young officers\\r\\nhad alone made this \"tapage,\" and that the Queen, \"formerly a timid\\r\\nand modest woman looking after her domestic concerns,\" had become\\r\\nturbulent and warlike, and had \"conducted the monarchy within a few\\r\\ndays to the brink of the precipice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Queen of Prussia was a beautiful woman, she has had nearly as\\r\\nmany partisans as Mary Stuart or Marie Antoinette, but with far less\\r\\ncause. Napoleon, who was the incarnation of practical common sense,\\r\\nsaw in her the first cause of the war, and considered that so far as\\r\\nverbal flagellation could punish her, she should have it. He had\\r\\nneither time nor sympathy for the \"Please you, do not hurt us\"\\r\\nattitude of a bellicose new woman, who, as Imogen or Ida, have played\\r\\nwith edged tools from the time of Shakespeare to that of Sullivan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an antidote, however, to his severe words against women he put,\\r\\nperhaps somewhat ostentatiously, the Princess d\\'Hatzfeld episode in\\r\\nhis Twenty-second Bulletin (Berlin, October 29th). A year later\\r\\n(November 26th, 1807), when his Old Guard return to Paris and free\\r\\nperformances are given at all the theatres, there is the \"Triumph of\\r\\nTrajan\" at the Opera, where Trajan, burning with his own hand the\\r\\npapers enclosing the secrets of a conspiracy, is a somewhat skilful\\r\\nallusion to the present episode.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagdeburg had surrendered on November 8th, with 20 generals, 800\\r\\nofficers and 22,000 men, 800 pieces of cannon, and immense stores.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lubeck._--This capitulation was that of Blucher, who had escaped\\r\\nafter Jena through a rather dishonourable ruse. It had taken three\\r\\narmy corps to hem him in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Berlin, but not included in the _Correspondence_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Madame L----_, _i.e._ Madame de la Rochefoucauld, a third or fourth\\r\\ncousin (by her first marriage) of Josephine, and her chief lady of\\r\\nhonour. She was an incorrigible Royalist, and hated Napoleon; but as\\r\\nshe had been useful at the Tuileries in establishing the Court,\\r\\nNapoleon, as usual, could not make up his mind to cause her dismissal.\\r\\nIn 1806, however, she made Josephine miserable and Mayence unbearable.\\r\\nShe foretold that the Prussians would win every battle, and even after\\r\\nJena she (to use an expression of M. Masson), \"continued her music on\\r\\nthe sly\" (_en sourdine_).

Madame Walewski,\\r\\nwho had not yet appeared on the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Desir de femme est un feu qui devore._--The quotation is given in\\r\\nJung\\'s \"Memoirs of Lucien\" (vol. ii. 62). \"Ce qu\\'une femme desire est\\r\\nun feu qui consume, celui d\\'une reine un vulcan qui devore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 23.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am dependent on events._--He says the same at St. Helena.\\r\\n\"Throughout my whole reign I was the keystone of an edifice entirely\\r\\nnew, and resting on the most slender foundations. Its duration\\r\\ndepended on the issue of my battles. I was never, in truth, master of\\r\\nmy own movements; I was never at my own disposal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 26.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The fair ones of Great Poland._--If Berthier and other regular\\r\\ncorrespondents of Josephine were like Savary in their enthusiasm, no\\r\\nwonder the Mayence coterie began to stir up jealousy. Here is the\\r\\ndescription of the Duke of Rovigo (vol. ii. 17): \"The stay at Warsaw\\r\\nhad for us something of witchery; even with regard to amusements it\\r\\nwas practically the same life as at Paris: the Emperor had his concert\\r\\ntwice a week, at the end of which he held a reception, where many of\\r\\nthe leading people met. A great number of ladies from the best\\r\\nfamilies were admired alike for the brilliancy of their beauty, and\\r\\nfor their wonderful amiability. One may rightly say that the Polish\\r\\nladies inspired with jealousy the charming women of every other\\r\\ncivilised clime. They united, for the most part, to the manners of\\r\\ngood society a fund of information which is not commonly found even\\r\\namong Frenchwomen, and is very far above anything we see in towns,\\r\\nwhere the custom of meeting in public has become a necessity. It\\r\\nseemed to us that the Polish ladies, compelled to spend the greater\\r\\npart of the year in their country-houses, applied themselves there to\\r\\nreading as well as to the cultivation of their talents, and it was\\r\\nthus that in the chief towns, where they went to pass the winter, they\\r\\nappeared successful over all their rivals.\" St. Amand says: \"In the\\r\\nintoxication of their enthusiasm and admiration, the most beautiful\\r\\namong them--and Poland is the country of beauty--lavished on him,\\r\\nlike sirens, their most seducing smiles....\" Josephine was right to be\\r\\njealous, for, as the artist Baron Lejeune adds, \"They were, moreover,\\r\\nas graceful as the Creole women so often are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_A wretched barn_, reached over still more wretched roads. The Emperor\\r\\nand his horse had nearly been lost in the mud, and Marshal Duroc had a\\r\\nshoulder put out by his carriage being upset.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Such things become common property._--So was another event, much to\\r\\nJosephine\\'s chagrin. On this date Napoleon heard of a son (Leon) born\\r\\nto him by Eleanore, a former schoolfellow of Madame Murat. M. Masson\\r\\nthinks this event epoch-making in the life of Napoleon. \"Henceforth\\r\\nthe charm is broken, and the Emperor assured of having an heir of his\\r\\nown blood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 27.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Warsaw, January 3._--On his way from Pultusk on January 1, he had\\r\\nreceived a Polish ovation at Bronie, where he first met Madame\\r\\nWalewski. The whole story is well told by M. Masson in _Napoleon et\\r\\nles Femmes_; but here we must content ourselves with the mere facts,\\r\\nand first, for the sake of comparison, cite his love-letters to the\\r\\nlady in question:--(1.) \"I have seen only you, I have admired only\\r\\nyou, I desire only you. A very prompt answer to calm the impatient\\r\\nardour of N.\" (2.) \"Have I displeased you? I have still the right to\\r\\nhope the contrary. Have I been mistaken? Your eagerness diminishes,\\r\\nwhile mine augments. You take away my rest! Oh, give a little joy, a\\r\\nlittle happiness to a poor heart all ready to worship you. Is it so\\r\\ndifficult to get a reply? You owe me one.--N.\" (3.) \"There are moments\\r\\nwhen too high rank is a burden, and that is what I feel. How can I\\r\\nsatisfy the needs of a heart hopelessly in love, which would fling\\r\\nitself at your feet, and which finds itself stopped by the weight of\\r\\nlofty considerations paralysing the most lively desires? Oh, if you\\r\\nwould! Only you could remove the obstacles that lie between us. My\\r\\nfriend Duroc will clear the way. Oh, come! come! All your wishes shall\\r\\nbe gratified. Your native land will be dearer to me when you have had\\r\\npity on my poor heart,--N.\" (4.) \"Marie, my sweet Marie! My first\\r\\nthought is for you, my first desire to see you again. You will come\\r\\nagain, will you not? You promised me to do so. If not, the eagle will\\r\\nfly to you. I shall see you at dinner, a friend tells me. Deign, then,\\r\\nto accept this bouquet; let it become a mysterious link which shall\\r\\nestablish between us a secret union in the midst of the crowd\\r\\nsurrounding us. Exposed to the glances of the crowd, we shall still\\r\\nunderstand each other. When my hand presses my heart, you will know\\r\\nthat it is full of thoughts of you; and in answer you will press\\r\\ncloser your bouquet. Love me, my bonny Marie, and never let your hand\\r\\nleave your bouquet.--N.\" In this letter, in which he has substituted\\r\\n_tu_ for _vous_, there is more passion than we have seen since 1796.\\r\\nThe fair lady now leaves her decrepit old husband, nearly fifty years\\r\\nher senior, and takes up her abode in Finckenstein Castle, for nearly\\r\\ntwo months of the interval between Eylau and Friedland. \"In order,\"\\r\\nsays Pasquier, \"that nothing should be lacking to characterise the\\r\\ncalm state of his mind and the security of his position, it was soon\\r\\nknown that he had seen fit to enjoy a pleasurable relaxation by\\r\\ncalling to him a Polish gentlewoman of excellent birth, with whom he\\r\\nhad contracted a _liaison_ while passing through Warsaw, and who, as a\\r\\nconsequence of this journey, had the honour of bearing him a son.\"\\r\\nRepudiated by her husband, she came to Paris, where she was very\\r\\nkindly treated by Josephine, who, having once seen her, found in her\\r\\nno rival, but an enthusiastic patriot, \"sacrificed to Plutus,\" as\\r\\nNapoleon told Lucien at Mantua a few months later, adding that \"her\\r\\nsoul was as beautiful as her face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 28.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Be cheerful--gai._--This adjective is a favourite one in letters to\\r\\nhis wife, and dates from 1796.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 29.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Roads unsafe and detestable._--The French troops used to say that the\\r\\nfour following words constituted the whole language of the Poles:\\r\\n_Kleba?_ _Niema._ _Vota?_ _Sara._ (\"Some bread? There is none. Some\\r\\nwater? We will go and fetch it.\") Napoleon one day passed by a\\r\\ncolumn of infantry suffering the greatest privations on account of the\\r\\nmud, which prevented the arrival of provisions. \"Papa, kleba?\"\\r\\nexclaimed a soldier. \"Niema,\" replied the Emperor. The whole column\\r\\nburst into a fit of laughter; they asked for nothing more. Baron\\r\\nLejeune, Constant, and Meneval have variants of the same story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 35.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Warsaw, and omitted from the _Correspondence_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I hope that you are at Paris._--Madame Junot hints that her husband,\\r\\nas Governor of Paris, was being sounded by Bonaparte\\'s sister, Murat\\'s\\r\\nwife (with whom Junot was in love), if he would make Murat Napoleon\\'s\\r\\nsuccessor, in lieu of Eugene, if the Emperor were killed. If Napoleon\\r\\nhad an inkling of this, he would wish Josephine to be on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n_T._--Is probably Tallien, who had misconducted himself in Egypt.\\r\\nMadame Junot met him at Madrid, but she and others had not forgotten\\r\\nthe September massacres. \"The wretch! how did he drag on his loathsome\\r\\nexistence?\" she exclaims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 36.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Paris._--Josephine arrived here January 31st; Queen Hortense going to\\r\\nthe Hague and the Princess Stephanie to Mannheim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 38.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably written from Arensdorf, on the eve of the battle of Eylau\\r\\n(February 9th), on which day a great ball took place in Paris, given\\r\\nby the Minister of Marine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 39.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eylau._--The battle of Preussich-Eylau was splendidly fought on both\\r\\nsides, but the Russian general, Beningsen, had all the luck. (1) His\\r\\nCossacks capture Napoleon\\'s letter to Bernadotte, which enables him to\\r\\nescape all Napoleon\\'s plans, which otherwise would have destroyed half\\r\\nthe Russian army. (2) A snowstorm in the middle of the day in the\\r\\nfaces of the French ruins Augereau\\'s corps and saves the Russians\\r\\nfrom a total rout. (3) The arrival of a Prussian army corps, under\\r\\nGeneral Lestocq, robbed Davoust of his glorious victory on the right,\\r\\nand much of the ground gained--including the village of Kuschnitten.\\r\\n(4) The night came on just in time to save the rest of the Russian\\r\\narmy, and to prevent Ney taking any decisive part in the battle.\\r\\nBernadotte, as usual, failed to march to the sound of the guns, but,\\r\\nas Napoleon\\'s orders to do so were captured by Cossacks, he might have\\r\\nhad an excuse rather better than usual, had not General Hautpoult,[62]\\r\\nin touch both with him and Napoleon, advised him of his own orders and\\r\\nan imminent battle. Under such circumstances, no general save the\\r\\nPrince of Ponte-Corvo, says Bignon, would have remained inactive, \"but\\r\\nit was the destiny of this marshal to have a role apart in all the\\r\\ngreat battles fought by the Emperor. His conduct was at least strange\\r\\nat Jena, it will not be less so, in 1809, at Wagram.\" The forces,\\r\\naccording to Matthieu Dumas (_Precis des Evenements Militaires_,\\r\\nvolume 18), were approximately 65,000 French against 80,000\\r\\nallies[63]--the latter in a strong chosen position. Napoleon saved\\r\\n1500, the wreckage of Augereau\\'s[64] corps, that went astray in the\\r\\nblizzard (costing the French more than half their loss in the two\\r\\ndays\\' fight), by a charge of his Horse Guard, but his Foot Guard never\\r\\nfired a shot. The allies lost 5000 to 6000 dead and 20,000 wounded.\\r\\nNapoleon told Montholon that his loss at Eylau was 18,000, which\\r\\nprobably included 2000 dead, and 15,000 to 16,000 wounded and\\r\\nprisoners. As the French remained masters of the field of battle, the\\r\\nslightly wounded were evidently not counted by Napoleon, who in his\\r\\nbulletin gives 1900 dead and 5700 wounded. The list of wounded inmates\\r\\nof the hospital a month later, March 8th, totalled only 4600, which\\r\\nastonished Napoleon, who sent back for a recount. On receipt of this\\r\\nhe wrote Daru (March 15): \"From your advices to hand, I see we are\\r\\nnot far out of count. There were at the battle of Eylau 4000 or 5000\\r\\nwounded, and 1000 in the combats preceding the battle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 40.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Corbineau._--Mlle. d\\'Avrillon (vol. ii. 101) tells how, in haste to\\r\\njoin his regiment at Paris, Corbineau had asked for a seat in her\\r\\ncarriage from St. Cloud. She was delighted, as he was a charming man,\\r\\n\"with no side on like Lauriston and Lemarois.\" He had just been made\\r\\ngeneral, and said, \"Either I will get killed or deserve the favour\\r\\nwhich the Emperor has granted me. M\\'selle, you shall hear me spoken\\r\\nof; if I am not killed I will perform some startling deed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Dahlmann._--General Nicholas Dahlmann, commanding the chasseurs of\\r\\nthe guard, was killed in the charge on the Russian infantry which\\r\\nsaved the battle. On April 22nd Napoleon wrote Vice-Admiral Decres to\\r\\nhave three frigates put on the stocks to be called Dahlmann,\\r\\nCorbineau, and Hautpoul, and in each captain\\'s cabin a marble\\r\\ninscription recounting their brave deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 41.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Young Tascher._--The third of Josephine\\'s cousins-germain of that\\r\\nname. He was afterwards aide-de-camp of Prince Eugene, and later\\r\\nmajor-domo of the Empress Eugenie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 42.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this letter St. Amand declares that Napoleon\\'s letters to his\\r\\nwife become \"cold, short, banal, absolutely insignificant.\" \"They\\r\\nconsisted of a few remarks about the rain or the fine weather, and\\r\\nalways the same refrain--the invitation to be cheerful.... Napoleon,\\r\\noccupied elsewhere, wrote no longer to his legitimate wife, but as a\\r\\nduty, as paying a debt of conscience.\" He was occupied, indeed, but\\r\\nbarely as the author supposes. It is Bingham (vol. ii. 281) who\\r\\nreminds us that in the first three months of 1807 we have 1715 letters\\r\\nand despatches preserved of his work during that period, while he\\r\\noften rode forty leagues a day, and had instructed his librarian to\\r\\nsend him by each morning\\'s courier two or three new books from Paris.\\r\\nAubenas is more just than St. Amand. \"If his style is no longer that\\r\\nof the First Consul, still less of the General of Italy, he was\\r\\nsolicitous, punctilious, attentive, affectionate even although\\r\\nlaconic, in that correspondence (with Josephine) which, in the midst\\r\\nof his much greater preoccupations, seems for him as much a pleasure\\r\\nas a duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 43.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am still at Eylau._--It took Napoleon and his army eight days to\\r\\nbury the dead and remove the wounded. Lejeune says, \"His whole time\\r\\nwas given up now to seeing that the wounded received proper care, and\\r\\nhe insisted on the Russians being as well treated as the French\" (vol.\\r\\ni. 48). The Emperor wrote Daru that if more surgeons had been on the\\r\\nspot he could have saved at least 200 lives; although, to look at the\\r\\nsurgical instruments used on these fields, and now preserved in the\\r\\nmuseum of Les Invalides, it is wonderful that the men survived\\r\\noperations with such ghastly implements of torture. A few days later\\r\\nNapoleon tells Daru on no account to begrudge money for medicines, and\\r\\nespecially for quinine.\\r\\n\\r\\n_This country is covered with dead and wounded._--\"Napoleon,\" says\\r\\nDumas (vol. i. 18, 41), \"having given order that the succour to the\\r\\nwounded on both sides might be multiplied, rode over the field of\\r\\nbattle, which all eye-witnesses agree to have been the most horrible\\r\\nfield of carnage which war has ever offered. In a space of less than a\\r\\nsquare league, the ground covered with snow, and the frozen lakes,\\r\\nwere heaped up with 10,000 dead, and 3000 to 4000 dead horses, debris\\r\\nof artillery, arms of all kinds, cannon-balls, and shells. Six\\r\\nthousand Russians, expiring of their wounds, and of hunger and thirst,\\r\\nwere left abandoned to the generosity of the conqueror.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 50.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Osterode._--\"A wretched village, where I shall pass a considerable\\r\\ntime.\" Owing to the messenger to Bernadotte being captured by\\r\\nCossacks, the Emperor, if not surprised at Eylau on the second day,\\r\\nfound at least all his own intentions anticipated. He could not\\r\\nrisk the same misfortune again, and at Osterode all his army were\\r\\nwithin easy hailing distance, \"within two marches at most\" (Dumas).\\r\\nSavary speaks of him there, \"working, eating, giving audience, and\\r\\nsleeping--all in the same room,\" alone keeping head against the storm\\r\\nof his marshals, who wished him to retire across the Vistula. He\\r\\nremained over five weeks at Osterode, and more than two months at\\r\\nFinckenstein Castle, interesting himself in the affairs of Teheran\\r\\nand Monte Video, offering prizes for discoveries in electricity\\r\\nand medicine, giving advice as to the most scientific modes of\\r\\nteaching history and geography, while objecting to the creation of\\r\\npoet-laureates or Caesarians whose exaggerated praises would be sure to\\r\\nawaken the ridicule of the French people, even if it attained its\\r\\nobject of finding a place of emolument for poets. Bignon says\\r\\n(vol. vi. 227): \"From Osterode or from Finckenstein he supervised,\\r\\nas from Paris or St. Cloud, the needs of France; he sought means to\\r\\nalleviate the hindrances to commerce, discussed the best ways to\\r\\nencourage literature and art, corresponded with all his ministers,\\r\\nand while awaiting the renewal of the fray, having a war of\\r\\nfigures with his Chancellor of Exchequer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_It is not as good as the great city._--The day before he had written\\r\\nhis brother Joseph that neither his officers nor his staff had taken\\r\\ntheir clothes off for two months; that he had not taken his boots off\\r\\nfor a fortnight; that the wounded had to be moved 120 miles in\\r\\nsledges, in the open air; that bread was unprocurable; that the\\r\\nEmperor had been living for weeks upon potatoes, and the officers upon\\r\\nmere meat. \"After having destroyed the Prussian monarchy, we are\\r\\nfighting against the remnant of the Prussians, against Russians,\\r\\nCossacks, and Kalmucks, those roving tribes of the north, who formerly\\r\\ninvaded the Roman Empire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_I have ordered what you wish for Malmaison._--About this time he also\\r\\ngave orders for what afterwards became the Bourse and the Madeleine,\\r\\nand gave hints for a new journal (March 7th), whose \"criticism should\\r\\nbe enlightened, well-intentioned, impartial, and robbed of that\\r\\nnoxious brutality which characterises the discussions of existing\\r\\njournals, and which is so at variance with the true sentiments of the\\r\\nnation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 54.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Minerva._--In a letter of March 7th Josephine writes to Hortense: \"A\\r\\nfew days ago I saw a frightful accident at the Opera. The actress who\\r\\nrepresented Minerva in the ballet of \\'Ulysses\\' fell twenty feet and\\r\\nbroke her arm. As she is poor, and has a family to support, I have\\r\\nsent her fifty louis.\" This was probably the ballet, \"The Return of\\r\\nUlysses,\" a subject given by Napoleon to Fouche as a suitable subject\\r\\nfor representation. In the same letter Josephine writes: \"All the\\r\\nprivate letters I have received agree in saying that the Emperor was\\r\\nvery much exposed at the battle of Eylau. I get news of him very\\r\\noften, sometimes two letters a day, but that does not replace him.\"\\r\\nThis special danger at Eylau is told by Las Cases, who heard it from\\r\\nBertrand. Napoleon was on foot, with only a few officers of his staff;\\r\\na column of four to five thousand Russians came almost in contact with\\r\\nhim. Berthier instantly ordered up the horses. The Emperor gave him a\\r\\nreproachful look; then sent orders to a battalion of his guard to\\r\\nadvance, which was a good way behind, and standing still. As the\\r\\nRussians advanced he repeated several times, \"What audacity, what\\r\\naudacity!\" At the sight of his Grenadiers of the Guard the Russians\\r\\nstopped short. It was high time for them to do so, as Bertrand said.\\r\\nThe Emperor had never stirred; all who surrounded him had been much\\r\\nalarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 55.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is the first and only time,\" says Aubenas, \"that, in these two\\r\\nvolumes of letters (_Collection Didot_), Napoleon says _vous_ to his\\r\\nwife. But his vexation does not last more than a few lines, and this\\r\\nshort letter ends, \\'_Tout a toi_.\\' Not content with this softening,\\r\\nand convinced how grieved Josephine will be at this language of cold\\r\\netiquette, he writes to her the same day, at ten o\\'clock at night,\\r\\nbefore going to bed, a second letter in his old style, which ends,\\r\\n\\'_Mille et mille amities_.\\'\" It is a later letter (March 25th) which\\r\\nends as described, but No. 56 is, nevertheless, a kind letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 56.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Dupuis._--Former principal of the Brienne Military School. Napoleon,\\r\\nalways solicitous for the happiness of those whom he had known in his\\r\\nyouth, had made Dupuis his own librarian at Malmaison. His brother,\\r\\nwho died in 1809, was the learned Egyptologist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 58.\\r\\n\\r\\n_M. de T----_, _i.e._ M. de Thiard. In _Lettres Inedites de Napoleon\\r\\nI._ (Brotonne), No. 176, to Talleyrand, March 22nd, the Emperor\\r\\nwrites: \"I have had M. de Thiard effaced from the list of officers. I\\r\\nhave sent him away, after having testified all my displeasure, and\\r\\ntold him to stay on his estate. He is a man without military honour\\r\\nand civic fidelity.... My intention is that he shall also be struck\\r\\noff from the number of my chamberlains. I have been poignantly grieved\\r\\nat such black ingratitude, but I think myself fortunate to have found\\r\\nout such a wicked man in time.\" De Thiard seems to have been\\r\\ncorresponding with the enemy from Warsaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 60.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Marshal Bessieres._--His chateau of Grignon, now destroyed, was one\\r\\nof the most beautiful of Provence. Madame de Sevigne lived and was\\r\\nburied in the town of Grignon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_No. 63._\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was printed April 24th in the French editions, but April 14th is\\r\\nevidently the correct date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 67.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Sweet, pouting, and capricious._\"--Aubenas speaks of these lines \"in\\r\\nthe style of the Italian period, which seemed in fact to calm the\\r\\nfears of the Empress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 68.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Madame ----._ His own sister, Madame Murat, afterwards Queen of\\r\\nNaples. See note to Letter 35 for her influence over Junot. The latter\\r\\nwas severely reprimanded by Napoleon on his return and banished from\\r\\nParis. \"Why, for example, does the Grand Duchess occupy your boxes at\\r\\nthe theatres? Why does she go thither in your carriage? Hey! M. Junot!\\r\\nyou are surprised that I am so well acquainted with your affairs and\\r\\nthose of that little fool, Madame Murat?\" (\"Memoirs of the Duchess\\r\\nd\\'Abrantes,\" vol. iii. 328.)\\r\\n\\r\\n_Measles._--As the poor child was ill four days, it was probably\\r\\nlaryngitis from which he died--an ailment hardly distinguishable from\\r\\ncroup, and one of the commonest sequelae of measles. He died on May\\r\\n5th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best account is the Memoirs of Stanislaus Giraudin. They had\\r\\napplied leeches to the child\\'s chest, and had finally recourse to some\\r\\nEnglish powders of unknown composition, which caused a rally, followed\\r\\nby the final collapse. King Louis said the child\\'s death was caused by\\r\\nthe Dutch damp climate, which was bad for his own health. Josephine\\r\\nhastens to join her daughter, but breaks down at Lacken, where\\r\\nHortense, more dead than alive, joins her, and returns to Paris with\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 69.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I trust I may hear you have been rational in your sorrow._--As a\\r\\nmatter of fact he had heard the opposite, for the following day\\r\\n(May 15th) he writes to his brother Jerome: \"Napoleon died in three\\r\\ndays at the Hague; I know not if the King has advised you of it.\\r\\nThis event gives me the more pain insomuch as his father and mother\\r\\nare not rational, and are giving themselves up to all the transports\\r\\nof their grief.\" To Fouche he writes three days later: \"I have\\r\\nbeen very much afflicted by the misfortune which has befallen me.\\r\\nI had hoped for a more brilliant destiny for that poor child;\" and on\\r\\nMay 20th, \"I have felt the loss of the little Napoleon very acutely.\\r\\nI would have wished that his father and mother should have received\\r\\nfrom their temperament as much courage as I for knowing how to bear\\r\\nall the ills of life. But they are younger, and have reflected less on\\r\\nthe frailty of our worldly possessions.\" It is typical of Napoleon\\r\\nthat the only man to whom, as far as we know, he unbosomed his\\r\\nsorrow should be one of his early friends, even though that friend\\r\\nshould be the false and faithless Fouche, who requited his confidence\\r\\nlater by vile and baseless allegations respecting the parentage of\\r\\nthis very child. In one respect only did Napoleon resemble David in\\r\\nhis supposititious sin, which was, that when the child was dead, he\\r\\nhad neither time nor temperament to waste in futile regrets. As he\\r\\nsaid on another occasion, if his wife had died during the Austerlitz\\r\\nCampaign it would not have delayed his operations a quarter of an\\r\\nhour. But he considers practical succour to the living as the most\\r\\nfitting memorial to the dead, and writes on June 4th to De Champagny:\\r\\n\"Twenty years ago a malady called croup showed itself in the north\\r\\nof Europe. Some years ago it spread into France. I require you to\\r\\noffer a prize of L500 (12,000 francs), to be given to the doctor who\\r\\nwrites the best essay on this malady and its mode of treatment.\"\\r\\nCommenting on this letter Bignon (vol. vi. p. 262) adds, \"It is,\\r\\nhowever, fortunate when, on the eve of battles, warlike princes are\\r\\npondering over ways of preserving the population of their states.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 71.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 20th._--On this date he writes Hortense: \"My daughter, all the\\r\\nnews I get from the Hague tells me that you are not rational. However\\r\\nlegitimate your grief, it must have limits: never impair your health;\\r\\nseek distractions, and know that life is strewn with so many rocks,\\r\\nand may be the source of so many miseries, that death is not the\\r\\ngreatest of all.--Your affectionate father, NAPOLEON.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 74.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am vexed with Hortense._--The same day he encloses with this a\\r\\nletter to Hortense. \"My daughter, you have not written me a line\\r\\nduring your great and righteous grief. You have forgotten everything,\\r\\nas if you had nothing more to lose. They say you care no longer for\\r\\nany one, that you are callous about everything; I note the truth of it\\r\\nby your silence. This is not well, Hortense, it is not what you\\r\\npromised me. Your son was everything for you. Are your mother and\\r\\nmyself nothing? Had I been at Malmaison I should have shared your\\r\\ngrief, but I should have wished you at the same time to turn to your\\r\\nbest friends. Good-bye, my daughter, be cheerful; it is necessary to\\r\\nbe resigned; keep well, in order to fulfil all your duties. My wife is\\r\\nutterly miserable about your condition; do not increase her\\r\\nsorrow.--Your affectionate father, NAPOLEON.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHortense had been on such bad terms with her husband for several\\r\\nmonths past that Napoleon evidently thinks it wiser not to allude to\\r\\nhim, although he had written Louis a very strong letter on his\\r\\ntreatment of his wife two months earlier (see letter 12,294 of the\\r\\n_Correspondence_, April 4th). There is, however, a temporary reunion\\r\\nbetween husband and wife in their common sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 78.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Friedland._--On this day he wrote a further letter to the Queen of\\r\\nHolland (No. 12,761 of the _Correspondence_): \"My daughter, I have\\r\\nyour letter dated Orleans. Your grief pains me, but I should like you\\r\\nto possess more courage; to live is to suffer, and the true man is\\r\\nalways fighting for mastery over himself. I do not like to see you\\r\\nunjust towards the little Napoleon Louis, and towards all your\\r\\nfriends. Your mother and I had hoped to be more to you than we are.\"\\r\\nShe had been sent to take the waters of Cauterets, and had left her\\r\\nchild Napoleon Louis (who died at Forli, 1831) with Josephine, who\\r\\nwrites to her daughter (June 11th): \"He amuses me much; he is so\\r\\ngentle. I find he has all the ways of that poor child that we mourn.\"\\r\\nAnd a few days later: \"There remains to you a husband, an interesting\\r\\nchild, and a mother whose love you know.\" Josephine had with women the\\r\\nsame tact that her husband had with men, but the Bonaparte family,\\r\\nwith all its good qualities, strained the tact and tempers of both to\\r\\nthe utmost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 79.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tilsit._--Referring to Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit, Michaud\\r\\nsays: \"Both full of wiles and devices, they affected nevertheless the\\r\\nmost perfect sentiments of generosity, which at the bottom they\\r\\nscarcely dreamed of practising. Reunited, they were the masters of the\\r\\nworld, but such a union seemed impossible; they would rather share it\\r\\namong themselves. Allies and rivals, friends and enemies, all were\\r\\nsacrificed; henceforth there were to be only two powers, that of the\\r\\nEast and that of the West. Bonaparte at this time actually ruled from\\r\\nthe Niemen to the Straits of Gibraltar, from the North Sea to the base\\r\\nof the Italian Peninsula.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [60] Bouillet, _Dictionnaire Universelle_, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [61] \"The Queen of that Court was the fair Madame Tallien.

Arriving here on the morning of the 22nd, Napoleon goes\\r\\nfirst to hear the _Te Deum_ at the Cathedral, then to see Eugene\\'s\\r\\nwife at the Monza Palace; in the evening to the La Scala Theatre, and\\r\\nfinishes the day (to use an Irishism) by working most of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Mont Cenis._--\"The roads of the Simplon and Mont Cenis were kept in\\r\\nthe finest order, and daily attracted fresh crowds of strangers to the\\r\\nItalian plains.\" So says Alison, but on the present occasion Napoleon\\r\\nwas overtaken by a storm which put his life in danger. He was\\r\\nfortunate enough to reach a cave in which he took refuge. This cave\\r\\nappeared to him, as he afterwards said, \"a cave of diamonds\"\\r\\n(Meneval).\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene._--The writer in _Biog. Univ._ (art. Josephine) says: \"During\\r\\na journey that Napoleon made in Italy (November 1807) he wished, while\\r\\nloading Eugene with favours, to prepare his mind for his mother\\'s\\r\\ndivorce. The Decree of Milan, by which, in default of male and\\r\\nlegitimate children[65] of _the direct_ _line_, he adopted Eugene for\\r\\nhis son and his successor to the throne of Italy, gave to those who\\r\\nknew how to read the secret thoughts of the Emperor in his patent acts\\r\\nthe proof that he had excluded him from all inheritance in the\\r\\nImperial Crown of France, and that he dreamed seriously of a new\\r\\nalliance himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Venice._--The Venetians gave Napoleon a wonderful ovation--many\\r\\nnobles spending a year\\'s income on the fetes. \"Innumerable gondolas\\r\\nglittering with a thousand colours and resounding with the harmony of\\r\\ninstruments, escorted the barges which bore, together with the master\\r\\nof the world, the Viceroy and the Vice-Queen of Italy, the King and\\r\\nQueen of Bavaria, the Princess of Lucca, the King of Naples (Joseph,\\r\\nwho stayed six days with his brother), the Grand Duke of Berg, the\\r\\nPrince of Neufchatel, and the greater part of the generals of the old\\r\\narmy of Italy\" (Thiers). While at Venice Napoleon was in easy touch\\r\\nwith the Porte, of which he doubtless made full use, while, _per\\r\\ncontra_, he was expected to give Greece her independence.\\r\\n\\r\\n_November 30th._--Leaving Milan, Napoleon came straight through\\r\\nBrescia to Verona, where he supped with the King and Queen of\\r\\nBavaria. The next morning he started for Vicenza through avenues of\\r\\nvine-encircled poplars and broad yellow wheat-fields which \"lay all\\r\\ngolden in the sunlight and the breeze\" (Constant). The Emperor\\r\\nwent to the theatre at Vicenza, and left again at 2 A.M. Spending the\\r\\nnight at Stra, he met the Venetian authorities early the next morning\\r\\nat Fusina.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Udine._--He is here on the 12th, and then hastens to meet his brother\\r\\nLucien at Mantua--the main but secret object of his journey to Italy.\\r\\nIt is _most_ difficult to gauge the details--was it a political or a\\r\\nconjugal question that made the interview a failure? Madame\\r\\nD\\'Abrantes, voicing the rumours of the day, thinks the former; Lucien,\\r\\nwriting Memoirs for his wife and children, declares it to be the\\r\\nlatter. Napoleon was prepared to legalise the children of his first\\r\\nwife, and marry the eldest to Prince Ferdinand, the heir to the\\r\\nSpanish crown; but Lucien considers the Bourbons to be enemies of\\r\\nFrance and of the Bonapartes. These Memoirs of Lucien are not perhaps\\r\\nvery trustworthy, especially where his prejudices overlap his memory\\r\\nor his judgment, but always instructive and very readable. When the\\r\\naccount of this interview was written (early in 1812), Lucien was an\\r\\nEnglish prisoner, furious that his brother has just refused to\\r\\nexchange him for \"some English Lords.\" Speaking of Josephine, the\\r\\nEmperor tells him that in spite of her reputation for good-nature, she\\r\\nis more malicious than generally supposed, although for her husband\\r\\n\"she has no nails\"; but he adds that rumours of impending divorce have\\r\\nmade life between them very constrained. \"Only imagine,\" continued the\\r\\nEmperor, \"that wife of mine weeps every time she has indigestion,\\r\\nbecause she says she thinks herself poisoned by those who wish me to\\r\\nmarry some one else. It is perfectly hateful.\" He said that Joseph\\r\\nalso thought of a divorce, as his wife gave him only daughters, and\\r\\nthat the three brothers might be remarried on the same day. The\\r\\nEmperor regretted not having taken the Princess Augusta, daughter of\\r\\nhis \"best friend, the King of Bavaria,\" for himself, instead of for\\r\\nEugene, who did not know how to appreciate her and was unfaithful. He\\r\\nwas convinced that Russia by invading India would overthrow England,\\r\\nand that his own soldiers were ready to follow him to the antipodes.\\r\\nHe ends by offering Lucien his choice of thrones--Naples, Italy, \"the\\r\\nbrightest jewel of my Imperial crown,\" or Spain[66] (Madame D\\'Abrantes\\r\\nadds _Prussia_), if he will give way about Madame Jouberthon and her\\r\\nchildren. \"Tout pour Lucien divorce, rien pour Lucien sans divorce.\"\\r\\nWhen Napoleon finds his brother obdurate he makes Eugene Prince of\\r\\nVenice, and his eldest daughter Princess of Bologna, with a large\\r\\nappanage. Lucien is in fresh disgrace within less than three months of\\r\\nthe Mantuan interview, for on March 11, 1808, Napoleon writes brother\\r\\nJoseph, \"Lucien is misconducting himself at Rome ... and is more Roman\\r\\nthan the Pope himself. His conduct has been scandalous; he is my open\\r\\nenemy, and that of France.... I will not permit a Frenchman, and one\\r\\nof my own brothers, to be the first to conspire and act against me,\\r\\nwith a rabble of priests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_I may soon be in Paris._--After leaving Milan he visits the\\r\\nfortifications at Alessandria, and is met by a torchlight procession\\r\\nat Marengo. Letters for two days (December 27-28th) are dated Turin,\\r\\nalthough Constant says he did not stop there. Crossing Mont Cenis on\\r\\nDecember 30th he reaches the Tuileries on the evening of New Year\\'s\\r\\nDay (1808).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [65] The Decree itself says \"nos enfants et descendants males,\\r\\n       legitimes et naturels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [66] On October 11th Prince Ferdinand had written Napoleon for \"the\\r\\n       honour of allying himself to a Princess of his august family\";\\r\\n       and Lucien\\'s eldest daughter was Napoleon\\'s only choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Bayonne_ is half-way between Paris and Madrid, nearly 600 miles from\\r\\neach. Napoleon arrived here April 15th, and left July 21st, returning\\r\\nwith Josephine _via_ Pau, Tarbes, Auch, Montauban, Agen, Bordeaux,\\r\\nRochefort, Nantes. Everywhere he received a hearty welcome, even, and\\r\\nespecially, in La Vendee. He arrives at Paris August 14th, hearing on\\r\\nAugust 3rd at Bordeaux of (what he calls) the \"horrible catastrophe\"\\r\\nof General Dupont at Baylen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A country-house._--The Chateau of Marrac. Marbot had stayed there in\\r\\n1803 with Augereau. Bausset informs us that this chateau had been\\r\\nbuilt either for the Infanta Marie Victoire engaged to Louis XV., or\\r\\nfor the Dowager Queen of Charles II., \"the bewitched,\" when she was\\r\\npacked off from Madrid to Bayonne (see Hume\\'s _Spain_, 1479-1788).\\r\\n\\r\\n_Everything is still most primitive._--Nevertheless he enjoyed the\\r\\n_pamperruque_ which was danced before the chateau by seven men and ten\\r\\nmaidens, gaily dressed--the women armed with tambourines and the men\\r\\nwith castanets. Saint-Amand speaks of thirteen performers (seven men\\r\\nand six maidens) chosen from the leading families of the town, to\\r\\nrender what for time immemorial had been considered fit homage for the\\r\\nmost illustrious persons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Prince of the Asturias._--The Emperor had received him at the chateau\\r\\nof Marrac, paid him all the honours due to royalty, while evading the\\r\\nword \"Majesty,\" and insisting the same day on his giving up all claim\\r\\nto the Crown of Spain. Constant says he was heavy of gait, and rarely\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Queen._--A woman of violent passions. The Prince of the Asturias\\r\\nhad designs on his mother\\'s life, while the Queen openly begged\\r\\nNapoleon to put the Prince to death. On May 9th Napoleon writes\\r\\nTalleyrand to prepare to take charge of Ferdinand at Valencay, adding\\r\\nthat if the latter were \"to become attached to some pretty woman, whom\\r\\nwe are sure of, it would be no disadvantage.\" A new experience for a\\r\\nMontmorency to become the keeper of a Bourbon, rather than his\\r\\nConstable. Pasquier, with his usual Malvolian decorum, gives fuller\\r\\ndetails. Napoleon, he says, \"enumerates with care (to Talleyrand) all\\r\\nthe precautions that are to be taken to prevent his escape, and even\\r\\ngoes so far as to busy himself with the distractions which may be\\r\\npermitted him. And, be it noted, the principal one thrown in his way\\r\\nwas given him by a young person who lived at the time under M. De\\r\\nTalleyrand\\'s roof. This liaison, of which Ferdinand soon became\\r\\ndistrustful, did not last as long as it was desired to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A son has been born._--By a plebiscite of the year XII. (1804-5), the\\r\\nchildren of Louis and Hortense were to be the heirs of Napoleon, and\\r\\nin conformity with this the child born on April 20th at 17 Rue Lafitte\\r\\n(now the residence of the Turkish Ambassador), was inscribed on the\\r\\nregister of the Civil List destined for princes of the blood. His two\\r\\nelder brothers had not been so honoured, but in due course the King of\\r\\nRome was entered thereon. Had Louis accepted the Crown of Spain which\\r\\nNapoleon had in vain offered to him, and of which Hortense would have\\r\\nmade an ideal Queen, the chances are that Napoleon would never have\\r\\ndivorced Josephine. St. Amand shows at length that the future Napoleon\\r\\nIII. is truly the child of Louis, and neither of Admiral Verhuell nor\\r\\nof the Duke Decazes. Louis and Hortense in the present case are\\r\\nsufficiently agreed to insist that the father\\'s name be preserved by\\r\\nthe child, who is called Charles Louis Napoleon, and not Charles\\r\\nNapoleon, which was the Emperor\\'s first choice. In either case the\\r\\nname of the croup-stricken firstborn had been preserved. On April 23rd\\r\\nJosephine had already two letters from Cambaceres respecting mother\\r\\nand child, and on this day the Empress writes her daughter: \"I know\\r\\nthat Napoleon is consoled for not having a sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Arrive on the 27th._--Josephine, always wishful to humour her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of punctuality, duly arrived on the day fixed, and took\\r\\nup her abode with her husband in the chateau of Marrac. Ferdinand\\r\\nwrote to his uncle in Madrid to beware of the cursed Frenchmen,\\r\\ntelling him also that Josephine had been badly received at Bayonne.\\r\\nThe letter was intercepted, and Napoleon wrote Murat that the writer\\r\\nwas a liar, a fool, and a hypocrite. The Emperor, in fact, never\\r\\ntrusted the Prince henceforward. Bausset, who translated the letter,\\r\\ntells how the Emperor could scarcely believe that the Prince would use\\r\\nso strong an adjective, but was convinced on seeing the word\\r\\n_maldittos_, which he remarked was almost the Italian--_maledetto_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES J\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving St. Cloud September 22nd, Napoleon is at Metz on the 23rd, at\\r\\nKaiserlautern on the 24th, where he sends a message to the Empress in\\r\\na letter to Cambaceres, and on the 27th is at Erfurt. On the 28th the\\r\\nEmperors of France and Russia sign a Convention of Alliance. Napoleon\\r\\nleaves Erfurt October 14th (the anniversary of Jena), travels\\r\\nincognito, and arrives St. Cloud October 18th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I have rather a cold._--Napoleon had insisted on going to explore a\\r\\nnew road he had ordered between Metz and Mayence, and which no one had\\r\\nventured to say was not complete. The road was so bad that the\\r\\ncarriage of the _maitre des requetes_, who had been summoned to\\r\\naccount for the faulty work, was precipitated a hundred feet down a\\r\\nravine near Kaiserlautern.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am pleased with the Emperor and every one here._--Which included\\r\\nwhat he had promised Talma for his audience--a _parterre_ of kings.\\r\\nBesides the two Emperors, the King of Prussia was represented by his\\r\\nbrother Prince William, Austria by General Vincent, and there were\\r\\nalso the Kings of Saxony, Bavaria, Wuertemberg, Westphalia, and Naples,\\r\\nthe Prince Primate, the Princes of Anhalt, Coburg, Saxe-Weimar,\\r\\nDarmstadt, Baden, and Nassau. Talleyrand, Champagny, Maret, Duroc,\\r\\nBerthier, and Caulaincourt, with Generals Oudinot, Soult, and\\r\\nLauriston accompanied Napoleon. Literature was represented by Goethe,\\r\\nWieland, Mueller; and feminine attractions by the Duchess of\\r\\nSaxe-Weimar and the wily Princess of Tour and Taxis, sister of the\\r\\nQueen of Prussia. Pasquier and others have proved that at Erfurt\\r\\nTalleyrand did far more harm than good to his master\\'s cause, and in\\r\\nfact intended to do so. On his arrival he spent his first evening with\\r\\nthe Princess of Tour and Taxis, in order to meet the Emperor\\r\\nAlexander, and said: \"Sire ... It is for you to save Europe, and the\\r\\nonly way of attaining this object is by resisting Napoleon. The French\\r\\npeople are civilised, their Emperor is not: the sovereign of Russia is\\r\\ncivilised, his people are not. It is therefore for the sovereign of\\r\\nRussia to be the ally of the French people,\"--of whom Talleyrand\\r\\ndeclared himself to be the representative. By squaring Alexander this\\r\\ntranscendental (unfrocked) Vicar of Bray, \"with an oar in every boat,\"\\r\\nis once more hedging, or, to use his own phrase, guaranteeing the\\r\\nfuture, and at the same time securing the daughter of the Duchess of\\r\\nCourland for his nephew, Edmond de Perigord. \"The Arch-apostate\"\\r\\ncarried his treason so far as to advise Alexander of Napoleon\\'s\\r\\nulterior views, and thus enabled the former to forestall them--no easy\\r\\nmatter in conversations with Napoleon \"lasting whole days\" (see\\r\\nLetter No. 3, this Series). Talleyrand had also a grievance. He had\\r\\nbeen replaced as Foreign Minister by Champagny. He had accepted the\\r\\nsurrender of his portfolio gladly, as now, becoming Vice-Grand\\r\\nElector, he ranked with Cambaceres and Maret. But when he found that\\r\\nNapoleon, who liked to have credit for his own diplomacy, seldom\\r\\nconsulted him, or allowed Champagny to do so, jealousy and ill-will\\r\\nnaturally resulted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Shooting over the battlefield of Jena._--The presence of the Emperor\\r\\nAlexander on this occasion was considered a great affront to his\\r\\nrecent ally, the King of Prussia, and is severely commented on by Von\\r\\nMoltke in one of his Essays. In fairness to Alexander, we must\\r\\nremember that their host, the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, had married his\\r\\nsister. Von Moltke, by the way, speaks of _hares_ forming the sport in\\r\\nquestion, but Savary of a second battle of Jena fought against the\\r\\n_partridges_. The fact seems to be that all kinds of game, including\\r\\nstags and deer, were driven by the beaters to the royal sportsmen in\\r\\ntheir huts, and the Emperor Alexander, albeit short-sighted, succeeded\\r\\nin killing a stag, at eight feet distance, _at the first shot_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Weimar ball._--This followed the Jena shoot, and the dancing\\r\\nlasted all night. The Russian courtiers were scandalised at their\\r\\nEmperor dancing, but while he was present the dancing was conventional\\r\\nenough, consisting of promenading two and two to the strains of a\\r\\nPolish march. \"Imperial Waltz, imported from the Rhine,\" was already\\r\\nthe rage in Germany, and Napoleon, in order to be more worthy of his\\r\\nAustrian princess, tried next year to master this new science of\\r\\ntactics, but after a trial with the Princess Stephanie, the lady\\r\\ndeclared that her pupil should always give lessons, and never receive\\r\\nthem. He was rather more successful at billiards, pursued under the\\r\\nsame praiseworthy incentive.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A few trifling ailments._--Mainly a fearful nightmare; a new\\r\\nexperience, in which he imagines his vitals torn out by a bear.\\r\\n\"Significant of much!\" As when also the Russian Emperor finds\\r\\nhimself without a sword and accepts that of Napoleon as a gift: and\\r\\nwhen, on the last night, the latter orders his comedians to play\\r\\n\"Bajazet,\"--little thinking the appointed Tamerlane was by his side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am pleased with Alexander._--For the time being Josephine had most\\r\\nreason to be pleased with Alexander, who failed to secure his sister\\'s\\r\\nhand for Napoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\n_He ought to be with me._--He might have been, had not Napoleon\\r\\npurposely evaded the Eastern Question. On this subject Savary\\r\\nwrites (vol. ii. 297):--\"Since Tilsit, Napoleon had sounded the\\r\\npersonal views of his ambassador at Constantinople, General\\r\\nSebastiani, as to this proposition of the Emperor of Russia (_i.e._\\r\\nthe partition of Turkey). This ambassador was utterly opposed to\\r\\nthis project, and in a long report that he sent to the Emperor on his\\r\\nreturn from Constantinople, he demonstrated to him that it was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary for France never to consent to the dismemberment\\r\\nof the Turkish Empire; the Emperor Napoleon adopted his views.\" And\\r\\nthese Talleyrand knew. The whirligig of time brings about its\\r\\nrevenges, and in less than fifty years Lord Palmerston had to seek\\r\\nan alliance with France and the house of Napoleon in order to\\r\\nmaintain the fixed policy that sent Napoleon I. to Moscow and to\\r\\nSt. Helena. \"Alexander, with justice,\" says Alison, \"looked upon\\r\\nConstantinople as the back-door of his empire, and was earnest that\\r\\nits key should be placed in his hands.\" \"Alexander,\" Napoleon told\\r\\nO\\'Meara, \"wanted to get Constantinople, which I would not allow,\\r\\nas it would have destroyed the equilibrium of power in Europe. I\\r\\nreflected that France would gain Egypt, Syria, and the islands,\\r\\nwhich would have been nothing in comparison with what Russia would\\r\\nhave obtained. I considered that the barbarians of the north were\\r\\nalready too powerful, and probably in the course of time would\\r\\noverwhelm all Europe, as I now think they will. Austria already\\r\\ntrembles: Russia and Prussia united, Austria falls, and England\\r\\ncannot prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Erfurt_ is the meridian of Napoleon\\'s first thirteen years\\r\\n(1796-1808)--each more glorious; henceforward (1809-1821) ever faster\\r\\nhe \"rolls, darkling, down the torrent of his fate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES K\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Aranda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from the Imperial Camp outside Madrid. Neither Napoleon[67]\\r\\nnor Joseph entered the capital, but King Joseph took up his abode at\\r\\nthe Prado, the castle of the Kings of Spain, two miles away; while the\\r\\nEmperor was generally at Chamartin, some five miles distant. He had\\r\\narrived on the heights surrounding Madrid on his Coronation Day\\r\\n(December 2nd), and does not fail to remind his soldiers and his\\r\\npeople of this auspicious coincidence. The bulletin concludes with a\\r\\ntirade against England, whose conduct is \"shameful,\" but her troops\\r\\n\"well disciplined and superb.\" It declares that Spain has been treated\\r\\nby them as they have treated Holland, Sardinia, Austria, Russia, and\\r\\nSweden. \"They foment war everywhere; they distribute weapons like\\r\\npoison; but they shed their blood only for their direct and personal\\r\\ninterests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Parisian weather of the last fortnight in May._--In his bulletin of\\r\\nthe 13th, he says: \"Never has such a month of December been known in\\r\\nthis country; one would think it the beginning of spring.\" But ten\\r\\ndays later all was changed, and the storm of Guadarrama undoubtedly\\r\\nsaved Moore and the English army. \"Was it then decreed,\" groans\\r\\nThiers, \"that we, who were always successful against combined Europe,\\r\\nshould on no single occasion prevail against those implacable foes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther letters of this date are headed Madrid.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Kourakin._--Alexander Kourakin was the new Russian Ambassador at\\r\\nParis, removed thence from Vienna to please Napoleon, and to replace\\r\\nTolstoi, who, according to Savary, was always quarrelling with French\\r\\nofficers on military points, but who could hardly be so narrow-minded\\r\\na novice on these points as his namesake of to-day. This matter had\\r\\nbeen arranged at Erfurt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The English appear to have received reinforcements._--Imagine a\\r\\nTransvaal with a population of ten millions, and one has a fair idea\\r\\nof the French difficulties in Spain, even without Portugal. The\\r\\nSpaniards could not fight a scientific battle like Jena or Friedland,\\r\\nbut they were incomparable at guerilla warfare. The Memoirs of Barons\\r\\nMarbot and Lejeune have well demonstrated this. The latter, an\\r\\naccomplished linguist, sent to locate Moore\\'s army, found that to pass\\r\\nas an Englishman the magic words \"Damn it,\" won him complete success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Benavente._--Here they found 600 horses, which had been hamstrung by\\r\\nthe English.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The English flee panic-stricken._--The next day Napoleon writes\\r\\nFouche to have songs written, and caricatures made of them, which are\\r\\nalso to be translated into German and Italian, and circulated in\\r\\nGermany and Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The weather is very bad._--Including 18 degrees of frost. Savary says\\r\\nthey had never felt the cold so severe in Poland--and that they ran a\\r\\nrisk of being buried in the snow. The Emperor had to march on foot and\\r\\nwas very much tired. \"On these occasions,\" adds Savary, \"the Emperor\\r\\nwas not selfish, as people would have us believe ... he shared his\\r\\nsupper[68] and his fire with all who accompanied him: he went so far\\r\\nas to make those eat whom he saw in need of it.\" Napier gives other\\r\\ndetails: \"Napoleon, on December 22nd, has 50,000 men at the foot of\\r\\nthe Guadarrama. A deep snow choked the passes of the Sierra, and after\\r\\ntwelve hours\\' toil the advanced guards were still on the wrong side:\\r\\nthe general commanding reported the road impracticable, but Napoleon,\\r\\ndismounting, placed himself at the head of the column, and amidst\\r\\nstorms of hail and driving snow, led his soldiers over the mountain.\"\\r\\nAt the passage of the Esla Moore escapes Napoleon by twelve hours.\\r\\nMarbot, as usual, gives picturesque details. Officers and men marched\\r\\nwith locked arms, the Emperor between Lannes and Duroc. Half-way up,\\r\\nthe marshals and generals, who wore jack-boots, could go no further.\\r\\nNapoleon, however, got hoisted on to a gun, and bestrode it: the\\r\\nmarshals and generals did the same, and in this grotesque order they\\r\\nreached, after four hours\\' toil, the convent at the summit.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lefebvre._--As they neared Benavente the slush became frightful, and\\r\\nthe artillery could not keep pace. General Lefebvre-Desnouette went\\r\\nforward, with the horse regiment of the Guard, forded the Esla with\\r\\nfour squadrons, was outnumbered by the English (3000 to 300), but he\\r\\nand sixty (Lejeune, who escaped, says a hundred) of his chasseurs were\\r\\ncaptured. He was brought in great triumph to Sir John Moore. \"That\\r\\ngeneral,\" says Thiers, \"possessed the courtesy characteristic of all\\r\\ngreat nations; he received with the greatest respect the brilliant\\r\\ngeneral who commanded Napoleon\\'s light cavalry, seated him at his\\r\\ntable, and presented him with a magnificent Indian sabre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably written from Astorga, where he arrived on January 1st, having\\r\\nbrought 50,000 men two hundred miles in ten days.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Your letters._--These probably, and others received by a courier,\\r\\ndecided him to let Soult follow the English to Corunna--especially as\\r\\nhe knew that transports were awaiting the enemy there. He himself\\r\\nprepares to return, for Fouche and Talleyrand are in league, the slim\\r\\nand slippery Metternich is ambassador at Paris, Austria is arming, and\\r\\nthe whole political horizon, apparently bright at Erfurt, completely\\r\\novercast. Murat, balked of the Crown of Spain, is now hoping for that\\r\\nof France if Napoleon is killed or assassinated. It is Talleyrand and\\r\\nFouche who have decided on Murat, and on the ultimate overthrow of the\\r\\nBeauharnais. Unfortunately for their plans Eugene is apprised by\\r\\nLavalette, and an incriminating letter to Murat captured and sent\\r\\npost-haste to Napoleon. This, says Pasquier, undoubtedly hastened the\\r\\nEmperor\\'s return. Ignoring the complicity of Fouche, the whole weight\\r\\nof his anger falls on Talleyrand, who loses the post of High\\r\\nChamberlain, which he had enjoyed since 1804. For half-an-hour this\\r\\n\"arch-apostate,\" as Lord Rosebery calls him, receives a torrent of\\r\\ninvectives. \"You are a thief, a coward, a man without honour; you do\\r\\nnot believe in God; you have all your life been a traitor to your\\r\\nduties; you have deceived and betrayed everybody: nothing is sacred to\\r\\nyou; you would sell your own father. I have loaded you down with\\r\\ngifts, and there is nothing that you would not undertake against me.\\r\\nThus, for the past ten months, you have been shameless enough, because\\r\\nyou supposed, rightly or wrongly, that my affairs in Spain were going\\r\\nastray, to say to all who would listen to you that you always blamed\\r\\nmy undertaking there, whereas it was yourself who first put it into my\\r\\nhead, and who persistently urged it. And that man, _that unfortunate_\\r\\n(he was thus designating the Duc d\\'Enghien), by whom was I advised of\\r\\nthe place of his residence? Who drove me to deal cruelly with him?\\r\\nWhat then are you aiming at? What do you wish for? What do you hope?\\r\\nDo you dare to say? You deserve that I should smash you like a\\r\\nwine-glass. I can do it, but I despise you too much to take the\\r\\ntrouble.\" This we are assured by the impartial Pasquier, who heard it\\r\\nfrom an ear-witness, and second-hand from Talleyrand, is an abstract\\r\\nof what Napoleon said, and to which the ex-Bishop made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 12.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The English are in utter rout._--Still little but dead men and horses\\r\\nfell into his hands. Savary adds the interesting fact that all the\\r\\n(800) dead cavalry horses had a foot missing, which the English had\\r\\nto show their officers to prove that they had not sold their horses.\\r\\nScott, on barely sufficient evidence perhaps, states, \"The very\\r\\ntreasure-chests of the army were thrown away and abandoned. There was\\r\\nnever so complete an example of a disastrous retreat.\" The fact seems\\r\\nto have been that the soldiership was bad, but Moore\\'s generalship\\r\\nexcellent. Napier writes, \"No wild horde of Tartars ever fell with\\r\\nmore license upon their rich effeminate neighbours than did the\\r\\nEnglish troops upon the Spanish towns taken by storm.\" What could be\\r\\nexpected of such men in retreat, when even Lord Melville had just said\\r\\nin extenuation of our army that the worst men make the best soldiers?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOS. 13 AND 14.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten at Valladolid. Here he received a deputation asking that his\\r\\nbrother may reside in Madrid, to which he agrees, and awaits its\\r\\narrangement before setting out for Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Valladolid he met De Pradt, whom he mistrusted; but who, like\\r\\nTalleyrand, always amused him. In the present case the Abbe told him\\r\\nthat \"the Spaniards would never thank him for interfering in their\\r\\nbehalf, and that they were like Sganarelle in the farce, who\\r\\nquarrelled with a stranger for interfering with her husband when he\\r\\nwas beating her\" (Scott\\'s \"Napoleon\").\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaves Valladolid January 17th, and is in Paris on January 24th. He\\r\\nrode the first seventy miles, to Burgos, in five and a half hours,\\r\\nstopping only to change horses.[69] Well might Savary say, \"Never had\\r\\na sovereign ridden at such a speed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene has a daughter._--The Princess Eugenie-Hortense, born December\\r\\n23rd at Milan; married the hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern\\r\\nHechingen.\\r\\n\\r\\n_They are foolish in Paris_--if not worse. Talleyrand, Fouche, and\\r\\nothers were forming what amounted to a conspiracy, and the Empress\\r\\nherself, wittingly or unwittingly, had served as their tool. For the\\r\\nfirst time she answers a deputation of the Corps Legislatif, who come\\r\\nto congratulate her on her husband\\'s victories, and says that\\r\\ndoubtless his Majesty would be very sensible of the homage of an\\r\\nassembly _which represents the nation_. Napoleon sees in this remark a\\r\\ngerm of aggression on behalf of his House of Commons, more especially\\r\\nwhen emphasised by 125 blackballs against a Government Bill. He takes\\r\\nthe effective but somewhat severe step of contradicting his wife in\\r\\nthe _Moniteur_, or rather declaring that the Empress knew the laws too\\r\\nwell not to know that the Emperor was the chief representative of the\\r\\nPeople, then the Senate, and last the Corps Legislatif.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be a wild and even criminal assertion to try to represent\\r\\nthe nation before the Emperor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll through the first half of 1809 another dangerous plot, of which\\r\\nthe centre was the Princess of Tour and Taxis, had its threads far and\\r\\nwide. Many of Soult\\'s generals were implicated, and in communication\\r\\nwith the English, preventing their commander getting news of\\r\\nWellesley\\'s movements (Napier). When they find Soult cannot be\\r\\ntraduced, they lend a willing ear to stirring up strife between the\\r\\nEmperor and Soult, by suggesting that the latter should be made King\\r\\nof Portugal. Madame d\\'Abrantes, who heard in 1814 that the idea had\\r\\nfound favour with English statesmen, thinks such a step would have\\r\\nseriously injured Napoleon (vol. iv. 53).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [67] Napoleon visited Madrid and its Palais Royal incognito, and (like\\r\\n       Vienna) by night (Bausset).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [68] With Lejeune on one occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [69] _Biographie Universelle._ Michaud says _ponies_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES L\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1809.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dangers surrounding Napoleon were immense. The Austrian army,\\r\\n320,000 strong (with her Landwehr, 544,000 men) and 800 cannon, had\\r\\nnever been so great, never so fitted for war. Prussia was already\\r\\nseething with secret societies, of which as yet the only formidable\\r\\none was the Tugendbund, whose headquarters were Konigsburg, and whose\\r\\nchief members were Stein, Stadion, Blucher, Jahn. Perhaps their most\\r\\nsensible scheme was to form a united German empire, with the Archduke\\r\\nCharles[70] as its head. The Archduke Ferdinand invaded the Duchy of\\r\\nWarsaw, and had he taken Thorn with its park of 100 cannon, Prussia\\r\\nwas to join Austria. In Italy the Carbonari and Adelphes[71] only\\r\\nwaited for the French troops to go north to meet the Austrians to\\r\\nspread revolt in Italy. Of the former the head lodge was at Capua and\\r\\nits constitutions written in English, since England was aiding this\\r\\n_chouanerie religieuse_ as a lever against Napoleon. England had an\\r\\narmy of 40,000 men ready to embark in any direction--to Holland,\\r\\nBelgium, Naples, or Biscay, while the French troops in Portugal were\\r\\nbeing tampered with to receive Moreau as their leader, and to march\\r\\nwith Spaniards and English for the Pyrenees. At Paris Talleyrand was\\r\\nin partial disgrace, but he and Fouche were still plotting--the\\r\\nlatter, says Pelet, forwarding daily a copy of the private bulletin\\r\\n(prepared for Napoleon\\'s eye alone) to the Bourbons. After Essling and\\r\\nthe breaking of the Danube bridge, he hesitated between seizing\\r\\nsupreme power himself or offering it to Bernadotte.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to the last--up to March 27th--the _Correspondence_ proves that\\r\\nNapoleon had hoped that war would be averted through the influence of\\r\\nRussia. \"All initiative,\" he declared, \"rested on the heads of the\\r\\ncourt of Austria.\" \"Menaced on all sides; warned of the intentions of his\\r\\nenemies by their movements and by their intercepted correspondence;\\r\\nseeing from that moment hostilities imminent, he wishes to prove to\\r\\nFrance and Europe that all the wrongs are on their side, and awaits in his\\r\\ncapital the news of an aggression that nothing justifies, nothing\\r\\nwarrants. Vain prudence! Europe will accuse him of having been the\\r\\ninstigator on every occasion, even in this.\"[72] On April 8th the\\r\\nAustrians violated Bavarian territory, and during his supreme command for\\r\\nthe next five days Berthier endangered the safety of the French empire\\r\\nin spite of the most elaborate and lucid instructions from Napoleon, which\\r\\nhe failed to comprehend. \"Never,\" says Pelet, \"was so much written, never\\r\\nso little done. Each of his letters (Berthier\\'s) attests the great\\r\\ndifference which existed between his own correspondence and that which\\r\\nwas dictated to him.\" An ideal chief of staff, he utterly lacked the\\r\\ndecision necessary for a commander-in-chief. The arrival of Napoleon\\r\\nchanged in a moment the position of affairs. \"The sudden apparition of the\\r\\nEmperor produced the effect of the head of Medusa, and paralysed the\\r\\nenemy.\"[73] Within five days the Austrians were four times defeated, and\\r\\nRatisbon, the _passe-partout_ of Southern Germany and half-way house\\r\\nbetween Strasburg and Vienna, is once more in the hands of France and her\\r\\nallies. Pelet considers these operations as the finest which have been\\r\\nexecuted either in ancient or modern times, at any rate those of which the\\r\\nprojects are authentically proved. He foretells that military men from\\r\\nevery country of Europe, but specially young Frenchmen, will religiously\\r\\nvisit the fields of the Laber. They will visit, with Napoleon\\'s\\r\\n_Correspondence_ in their hands, \"much more precious than every other\\r\\ncommentary, the hills of Pfaffenhofen, the bridge of Landshut, and that\\r\\nof Eckmuehl, the mill of Stangl, and the woods of Roking.\" A few days\\r\\nlater the Archduke Charles writes a letter to Napoleon, which is a fair\\r\\ntype of those charming yet stately manners which made him at that\\r\\nmoment the most popular man in Europe. \"Sire,\" he writes, \"your\\r\\nMajesty\\'s arrival was announced to me by the thunder of artillery, without\\r\\ngiving me time to compliment you thereon. Scarcely advised of your\\r\\npresence, I was made sensible of it by the losses which you have caused\\r\\nme. You have taken many of my men, Sire; my troops also have made some\\r\\nthousands of prisoners in places where you did not direct the\\r\\noperations. I propose to your Majesty to exchange them man for man, grade\\r\\nfor grade, and if that offer is agreeable to you, please let me know your\\r\\nintentions for the place destined for the exchange. I feel flattered,\\r\\nsire, in fighting against the greatest captain of the age. I should be\\r\\nmore happy if destiny had chosen me to procure for my country the\\r\\nbenefit of a lasting peace. Whichsoever they be, the events of war or\\r\\nthe approach of peace, I beg your Majesty to believe that my desires\\r\\nalways carry me to meet you, and that I hold myself equally honoured in\\r\\nfinding the sword, or the olive branch, in the hand of your Majesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_DONAUWERTH._--\\r\\nn the same day napoleon writes almost an identical\\r\\nletter to cambaceres, adding, however, the news that the tyrolese are\\r\\nin full revolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn april 20th he placed himself at the head of the wurtembergers and\\r\\nbavarians at abensberg. he made a stirring speech (no. 15,099 of\\r\\n_correspondence_), and lejeune tells us that the prince royal of\\r\\nbavaria translated into german one sentence after another as the\\r\\nemperor spoke, and officers repeated the translations throughout the\\r\\nranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn april 24th is issued from Ratisbon his proclamation to the\\r\\narmy:--\"Soldiers, you have justified my expectations. You have made\\r\\nup for your number by your bravery. You have gloriously marked the\\r\\ndifference between the soldiers of Caesar and the armed cohorts of\\r\\nXerxes. In a few days we have triumphed in the pitched battles of\\r\\nThann, Abensberg, and Eckmuehl, and in the combats of Peising,\\r\\nLandshut, and Ratisbon. A hundred cannon, forty flags, fifty thousand\\r\\nprisoners.... before a month we shall be at Vienna.\" It was within\\r\\nthree weeks! He was specially proud of Eckmuehl, and we are probably\\r\\nindebted to a remark of Pasquier for his chief but never divulged\\r\\nreason. \"A noteworthy fact in connection with this battle was that\\r\\nthe triumphant army was composed principally of Bavarians and\\r\\nWurtembergers. Under his direction, these allies were as greatly to be\\r\\nfeared as the French themselves.\" At St. Helena was written: \"The\\r\\nbattle of Abensberg, the manoeuvres of Landshut, and the battle of\\r\\nEckmuehl were the most brilliant and the most skilful manoeuvres of\\r\\nNapoleon.\" Eckmuehl ended with a fine exhibition of a \"white arm\"\\r\\nmelee by moonlight, in which the French proved the superiority of\\r\\ntheir double cuirasses over the breastplates of the Austrians.\\r\\nPelet gives this useful abstract of the campaign of five days:--\\r\\n\\r\\n_April 19th._--Union of the french army whilst fighting the Archduke,\\r\\nwhose base is already menaced.\\r\\n\\r\\n_April 20th._--Napoleon, at Abensberg and on the banks of the Laber,\\r\\nbreaks the Austrian line, totally separating the centre from the left,\\r\\nwhich he causes to be turned by Massena.\\r\\n\\r\\n_April 21st._--He destroys their left wing at Landshut, and captures\\r\\nthe magazines, artillery, and train, as well as the communications of\\r\\nthe enemy\\'s grand army, fixing definitely his own line of operations,\\r\\nwhich he already directs on Vienna.\\r\\n\\r\\n_April 22nd._--He descends the Laber to Eckmuehl, gives the last blow\\r\\nto the Archduke\\'s army, of which the remnant takes refuge in\\r\\nRatisbon.\\r\\n\\r\\n_april 23rd._--He takes that strong place, and forces the Archduke to\\r\\ntake refuge in the mountains of Bohemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 6th._--On May 1st Napoleon was still at Braunau, waiting for news\\r\\nfrom Davoust. Travelling by night at his usual speed he reached\\r\\nLambach at noon on May 2nd, and Wels on the 3rd. The next morning he\\r\\nheard Massena\\'s cannon at Ebersberg, but reaches the field at the fall\\r\\nof night--too late to save the heavy cost of Massena\\'s frontal attack.\\r\\nThe French lost at least 1500 killed and wounded; the Austrians (under\\r\\nHiller) the same number killed and 7000 prisoners. Pelet defends\\r\\nMassena, and quotes the bulletin of May 4th (omitted from the\\r\\n_Correspondence_): \"It is one of the finest feats of arms of which\\r\\nhistory can preserve the memory! The traveller will stop and say, \\'It\\r\\nis here, it is here, in these superb positions, that an army of 35,000\\r\\nAustrians was routed by two French divisions\\'\" (Pelet, ii. 225).\\r\\nLejeune, and most writers, blame Massena, referring to the Emperor\\'s\\r\\nletter of May 1st in Pelet\\'s Appendix (vol. ii.), but not in the\\r\\n_Correspondence_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween April 17th and May 6th there is no letter to Josephine\\r\\npreserved, but plenty to Eugene, and all severe--not so much for\\r\\nincapacity as for not keeping the Emperor advised of what was really\\r\\nhappening. On May 6th he had received no news for over a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The ball that touched me_--_i.e._ at Ratisbon. This was the second\\r\\ntime Napoleon had been wounded in battle--the first time by an\\r\\nEnglish bayonet at Toulon. On the present occasion (April 23rd)\\r\\nMeneval seems to be the best authority: \"Napoleon was seated on a\\r\\nspot from which he could see the attack on the town of Ratisbon. He\\r\\nwas beating the ground with his riding-whip,[74] when a bullet,\\r\\nsupposed to have been fired from a Tyrolean carbine, struck him on the\\r\\nbig toe (Marbot says \\'right ankle,\\' which is correct). The news of\\r\\nhis wound spread rapidly[75] from file to file, and he was forced\\r\\nto mount on horseback to show himself to his troops. Although his\\r\\nboot had not been cut the contusion was a very painful one,\" and in\\r\\nthe first house he went to for a moment\\'s rest, he fainted. The next\\r\\nday, however, he saw the wounded and reviewed his troops as usual,\\r\\nand Lejeune has preserved a highly characteristic story, somewhat\\r\\nsimilar to an experience of the Great Frederick\\'s: \"When he had\\r\\nreached the seventh or eighth sergeant the Emperor noticed a\\r\\nhandsome young fellow with fine but stern-looking eyes and of\\r\\nresolute and martial bearing, who made his musket ring again as he\\r\\npresented arms. \\'How many wounds?\\' inquired the Emperor. \\'Thirty,\\'\\r\\nreplied the sergeant. \\'I am not asking you your age,\\' said the Emperor\\r\\ngraciously; \\'I am asking how many wounds you have received.\\' Raising\\r\\nhis voice, the sergeant again replied with the one word, \\'Thirty.\\'\\r\\nAnnoyed at this reply, the Emperor turned to the colonel and said,\\r\\n\\'The man does not understand; he thinks I am asking about his\\r\\nage.\\' \\'He understands well enough, sire,\\' was the reply; \\'he has been\\r\\nwounded thirty times.\\' \\'What!\\' exclaimed the Emperor, \\'you have been\\r\\nwounded so often and have not got the cross!\\' The sergeant looked\\r\\ndown at his chest, and seeing that the strap of his cartridge-pouch\\r\\nhid his decoration, he raised it so as to show the cross. He said\\r\\nto the Emperor, with great earnestness, \\'Yes, I\\'ve got one; but I\\'ve\\r\\nmerited a dozen!\\' The Emperor, who was always pleased to meet\\r\\nspirited fellows such as this, pronounced the sacramental words,\\r\\n\\'I make you an officer!\\' \\'That\\'s right, Emperor,\\' said the new\\r\\nsub-lieutenant as he proudly drew himself up; \\'you couldn\\'t have\\r\\ndone better!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost an exact duplicate of this letter goes on to Paris to\\r\\nCambaceres, as also of No. 4. The moment the Emperor had heard that\\r\\nthe Archduke had left Budweiss and was going by the circuitous route\\r\\n_via_ Krems to Vienna, he left Enns (May 7th) and reached Moelk the\\r\\nsame evening. Seeing a camp of the enemy on the other side of the\\r\\nriver he sends Marbot with a sergeant and six picked men to kidnap a\\r\\nfew Austrians during the night. The foray is successful, and three are\\r\\nbrought before Napoleon, one weeping bitterly. The Emperor asked the\\r\\nreason, and found it was because he had charge of his master\\'s girdle,\\r\\nand would be thought to have robbed him. The Emperor had him set free\\r\\nand ferried across the river, saying, \"We must honour and aid virtue\\r\\nwherever it shows itself.\" The next day he started for Saint-Polten\\r\\n(already evacuated by Hiller). On his way he saw the ruins of\\r\\nDirnstein Castle, where Richard Coeur de Lion had been imprisoned. The\\r\\nEmperor\\'s comments were interesting, but are now hackneyed, and are in\\r\\nmost histories and memoirs--the parent source being Pelet (vol. ii.\\r\\n246).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Schoenbrunn_, situated a mile from Vienna, across the little river of\\r\\nthat name. Constant thus describes it: \"Built in 1754 by the\\r\\nEmpress Marie Therese, Schoenbrunn had an admirable position; its\\r\\narchitecture, if defective and irregular, was yet of a majestic,\\r\\nimposing type. To reach it one has to cross the bridge across the\\r\\nlittle river Vienna. Four stone sphinxes ornament this bridge, which\\r\\nis very large and well built. Facing the bridge there is a handsome\\r\\ngate opening on to a large courtyard, spacious enough for seven or\\r\\neight thousand men to manoeuvre in. The courtyard is in the form\\r\\nof a quadrangle surrounded by covered galleries and ornamented with\\r\\ntwo large basins, in which are marble statues. On both sides of\\r\\nthe gateway are two huge obelisks of pink stone surmounted by gilt\\r\\neagles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In German, Schoenbrunn means \\'fair spring,\\' and the name is derived\\r\\nfrom a fresh and sparkling spring which is situated in the park. It\\r\\nwells forth from a little mound on which a tiny grotto has been built,\\r\\ncarved within so as to resemble stalactites. Inside the grotto is a\\r\\nrecumbent naiad holding a horn, from which the water falls down into a\\r\\nmarble basin. In summer this little nook is deliciously cool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The interior of the palace merits nothing but praise. The furniture\\r\\nis sumptuous, and in taste both original and distinguished. The\\r\\nEmperor\\'s bedroom (the only place in the whole edifice where there was\\r\\na chimney) was upholstered in Chinese lacquer-wood of great antiquity,\\r\\nyet the painting and gilding were still quite fresh. The study\\r\\nadjoining was decorated in a like way. All these apartments, except\\r\\nthe bedroom, were heated in winter by immense stoves, which sadly\\r\\nspoilt the effect of the other furniture. Between the study and the\\r\\nbedroom there was a strange apparatus called a \\'flying chair,\\' a sort\\r\\nof mechanical seat, which had been constructed for the Empress Marie\\r\\nTherese, and which served to transport her from one floor to another,\\r\\nso that she was not obliged to go up and down the staircase like every\\r\\none else. The machine was worked in the same way as at theatres, by\\r\\ncords, pulleys, and a counter-weight.\" The Emperor drank a glassful\\r\\nfrom the beautiful spring, Schoen Brunn, every morning. Napoleon found\\r\\nthe people of Vienna less favourable to the French than in 1805; and\\r\\nCount Rapp told him \"the people were everywhere tired of us and of our\\r\\nvictories.\" \"He did not like these sort of reflections.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 12th._--On May 13th is dated the _seventh_ bulletin of the\\r\\narmy of Germany, but none of the Bulletins 2 to 6 are in the\\r\\n_Correspondence_. It states that on the 10th he is before Vienna; the\\r\\nArchduke Maximilian refuses to surrender; on the 11th, at 9 P.M., the\\r\\nbombardment commences, and by daybreak the city capitulated, and the\\r\\nArchduke fled. In his proclamation Napoleon blamed him and the\\r\\nhouse of Austria for the bombardment. \"While fleeing from the city,\\r\\ntheir adieux to the inhabitants have been murder and arson; like\\r\\nMedea, they have with their own hands slain their children.\" The\\r\\nViennese had sworn to emulate their ancestors in 1683, and the heroes\\r\\nof Saragossa. But Alison (than whom none can do the \"big bow-wow\"\\r\\nstyle better) has a thoughtful comment on what really occurred. \"All\\r\\nhistory demonstrates that there is one stage of civilisation when the\\r\\ninhabitants of a metropolis are capable of such a sacrifice in defence\\r\\nof their country, and only one; and that when passed, it is never\\r\\nrecovered. The event has proved that the Russians, in 1812, were in\\r\\nthe state of progress when such a heroic act was possible, but\\r\\nthat the inhabitants of Vienna and Paris had passed it. Most\\r\\ncertainly the citizens of London would never have buried themselves\\r\\nunder the ruins of the Bank, the Treasury, or Leadenhall Street\\r\\nbefore capitulating to Napoleon.\" 1870 and the siege of Paris modify\\r\\nthis judgment; but the Prussian bombardment came only at the last,\\r\\nand barely reached the centre of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ebersdorf._--Written five days after the murderous battle of Essling.\\r\\nMontgaillard, whose temper and judgment, as Alison remarks, are not\\r\\nequal to his talents, cannot resist a covert sneer (writing under the\\r\\nBourbons) at Napoleon\\'s generalship on this occasion, although he adds\\r\\na veneer by reminding us that Caesar was defeated at Dyrrachium,\\r\\nTurenne at Marienthal, Eugene at Denain, Frederick the Great at Kolin.\\r\\nThe crossing of the river was one which none but a victorious army,\\r\\nwith another[76] about to join it, could afford to risk, but which\\r\\nhaving effected, the French had to make the best of. As Napoleon said\\r\\nin his tenth bulletin, \"The passage of a river like the Danube, in\\r\\nfront of an enemy knowing perfectly the localities, and having the\\r\\ninhabitants on its side, is one of the greatest operations of war\\r\\nwhich it is possible to conceive.\" The Danube hereabouts is a thousand\\r\\nyards broad, and thirty feet deep. But the rising of its water\\r\\nfourteen feet in three days was what no one had expected. At Ebersdorf\\r\\nthe first branch of the Danube was 500 yards across to an islet,\\r\\nthence 340 yards across the main current to Lobau, the vast island\\r\\nthree miles broad and nearly three miles long, separated from the\\r\\nfarther bank by another 150 yards of Danube. Bertrand had made\\r\\nexcellent bridges, but on the 22nd the main one was carried away by a\\r\\nfloating mill.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene ... has completely performed the task._--At the commencement\\r\\nof the campaign the Viceroy was taken unprepared. The Archduke John,\\r\\nexactly his own age (twenty-seven), was burning with hatred of France.\\r\\nEugene had the impudence, with far inferior forces, to attack him at\\r\\nSacile on April 16th, but was repulsed with a loss (including\\r\\nprisoners) of 6000 men. It is now necessary to retire, and the\\r\\nArchduke follows him leisurely, almost within sight of Verona. By the\\r\\nend of April the news of Eckmuehl has reached both armies, and by May\\r\\n1st the Austrians are in full retreat. As usual, Napoleon has already\\r\\ndivined their altered plan of campaign, and writes from Braunau on\\r\\nthis very day, \"I doubt not that the enemy may have retired before\\r\\nyou; it is necessary to pursue him with activity, whilst coming to\\r\\njoin me as soon as possible _via_ Carinthia. The junction with my army\\r\\nwill probably take place beyond Bruck. It is probable I shall be at\\r\\nVienna by the 10th to the 15th of May.\" It is the successful\\r\\nperformance of this task of joining him and of driving back the enemy\\r\\nto which Napoleon alludes in the letter. The Viceroy had been reproved\\r\\nfor fighting at Sacile without his cavalry, for his precipitous\\r\\nretreat on Verona; and only two days earlier the Emperor had told him\\r\\nthat if affairs went worse he was to send for the King of Naples\\r\\n(Murat) to take command. \"I am no longer grieved at the blunders you\\r\\nhave committed, but because you do not write to me, and give me no\\r\\nchance of advising you, and even of regulating my own affairs here\\r\\nconformably.\" On May 8th Eugene defeats the Austrians on the Piave,\\r\\nand the Archduke John loses nearly 10,000 men and 15 cannon. Harassed\\r\\nin their retreat, they regain their own territory on May 14th--the day\\r\\nafter the capitulation of Vienna. Henceforward Eugene with part of the\\r\\narmy, and Macdonald with the rest, force their way past all\\r\\ndifficulties, so that when the junction with the Grand Army occurs at\\r\\nBruck, Napoleon sends (May 27th) the following proclamation: \"Soldiers\\r\\nof the army of Italy, you have gloriously attained the goal that I\\r\\nmarked out for you.... Surprised by a perfidious enemy before your\\r\\ncolumns were united, you had to retreat to the Adige. But when you\\r\\nreceived the order to advance, you were on the memorable fields of\\r\\nArcola, and there you swore on the manes of our heroes to triumph. You\\r\\nhave kept your word at the battle of the Piave, at the combats of\\r\\nSan-Daniel, Tarvis, and Goritz; you have taken by assault the forts of\\r\\nMalborghetto, of Prediel, and made the enemy\\'s divisions, entrenched\\r\\nin Prewald and Laybach, surrender. You had not then passed the Drave,\\r\\nand already 25,000 prisoners, 60 cannon, and 10 flags signalised your\\r\\nvalour.\" This is the proclamation alluded to in this letter to\\r\\nJosephine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_May 29th._--The date is wrong; it should be May 19th or 24th,\\r\\nprobably the latter. It sets at rest the vexed question how the Danube\\r\\nbridge was broken, and seems to confirm Marbot\\'s version of a floating\\r\\nmill on fire, purposely sent down by an Austrian officer of Jaegers,\\r\\nwho won the rare order of Maria Theresa thereby--for performing _more_\\r\\nthan his duty. Bertrand gained his Emperor\\'s lifelong admiration by\\r\\nhis expedients at this time. Everything had to be utilised--anchors\\r\\nfor the boat bridges were made by filling fishermen\\'s baskets with\\r\\nbullets; and a naval contingent of 1200 bluejackets from Antwerp\\r\\nproved invaluable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I have ordered the two princes to re-enter France._--After so\\r\\ncritical a battle as the battle of Essling the Emperor\\'s first\\r\\nthoughts were concerning his succession--had he been killed or\\r\\ncaptured. He was therefore seriously annoyed that the heir-apparent\\r\\nand his younger brother had both been taken out of the country without\\r\\nhis permission. He therefore writes the Queen of Holland on May 28th\\r\\nfrom Ebersdorf: \"My daughter, I am seriously annoyed that you have\\r\\nleft France without my permission, and especially that you have taken\\r\\nmy nephews out of it. Since you are at Baden stay there, but an hour\\r\\nafter receiving the present letter send my two nephews back to\\r\\nStrasburg to be near the Empress--they ought never to go out of\\r\\nFrance. It is the first time I have had reason to be annoyed with\\r\\nyou, but you should not dispose of my nephews without my permission,\\r\\nyou should realise what a bad effect it will have. Since the waters at\\r\\nBaden are doing you good you can stay there a few days, but, I repeat,\\r\\nlose not a moment in sending my nephews back to Strasburg. If the\\r\\nEmpress is going to the waters at Plombieres they may accompany her\\r\\nthere, but they must never pass the bridge of Strasburg.--Your\\r\\naffectionate father, Napoleon.\" This letter passed through the hands\\r\\nof Josephine at Strasburg, who was so unhappy at not having heard from\\r\\nher husband that she opened it, and writes to Hortense on June 1st\\r\\nwhen forwarding the letter: \"I advise you to write to him immediately\\r\\nthat you have anticipated his intentions, and that your children are\\r\\nwith me: that you have only had them a few days in order to see them,\\r\\nand to give them a change of air. The page who is announced in\\r\\nMeneval\\'s letter has not yet arrived. I hope he will bring me a letter\\r\\nfrom the Emperor, and that at least he will not be as vexed with me\\r\\nfor your being at Baden. Your children have arrived in excellent\\r\\nhealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Duke of Montebello, who died this morning._--The same day he\\r\\nwrites to La Marechale as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Ma Cousine_,--The Marshal died this morning of the wounds that he\\r\\nreceived on the field of honour. My sorrow equals yours. I lose the\\r\\nmost distinguished general in my whole army, my comrade-in-arms for\\r\\nsixteen years, he whom I looked upon as my best friend. His family and\\r\\nchildren will always have a special claim on my protection. It is to\\r\\ngive you this assurance that I wished to write you this letter, for I\\r\\nfeel that nothing can alleviate the righteous sorrow that you will\\r\\nexperience.\" The following year he bestowed the highest honour on the\\r\\nMarechale that she could receive.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Thus everything ends._--The fourteenth bulletin says that the end was\\r\\ncaused by a pernicious fever, and in spite of Dr. Franck, one of the\\r\\nbest physicians in Europe. \"Thus ends one of the most distinguished\\r\\nsoldiers France ever possessed.\"[77] He had received thirteen wounds.\\r\\nThe death of Lannes, and the whole of the Essling period, is best\\r\\ntold by Marbot. The loss of Lannes was a more serious one to Napoleon\\r\\nthan the whole 20,000 men lost in this battle. The master himself has\\r\\ntold us that \"in war men are nothing, a man is everything.\" They could\\r\\nbe replaced: Lannes never. Like Kleber and Desaix, he stood on a\\r\\nhigher platform than the older Marshals--except Massena, who had\\r\\nserious drawbacks, and who was the only one of Napoleon\\'s best\\r\\ngenerals that Wellington met in the Peninsula. Lannes had always the\\r\\near of the Emperor, and always told him facts, not flattery. His life\\r\\nhad been specially crowded the last few weeks. Rebuked by Napoleon for\\r\\ntardiness in supporting Massena at Ebersberg, his life was saved by\\r\\nNapoleon himself when he was thrown from his horse into the flooded\\r\\nDanube; and finally, on the field of Essling, he had under his orders\\r\\nBessieres, the man who had a dozen years before prevented his\\r\\nengagement to Caroline Bonaparte by tittle-tattling to Napoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene won a battle._--The remnant of the Archduke John\\'s army,\\r\\ntogether with Hungarian levies, in all 31,000 men, hold the\\r\\nentrenched camp and banks of the Raab. Eugene defeats it, with a\\r\\nloss of 6000 men, of whom 3700 were prisoners. Napoleon, in\\r\\ncommemoration of the anniversary of Marengo (and Friedland) calls it\\r\\nthe little granddaughter of Marengo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curtain of the war\\'s final act was rung up in the twenty-fourth\\r\\nbulletin. \"At length there exists no longer the Danube for the French\\r\\narmy; General Count Bertrand has completed works which excite\\r\\nastonishment and inspire admiration. For 800 yards over the most rapid\\r\\nriver in the world he has, in a fortnight, constructed a bridge of\\r\\nsixteen arches where three carriages can pass abreast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wagram_ is, according to Pelet, the masterpiece of _tactical_\\r\\nbattles, while the five days\\' campaign (Thann to Ratisbon) was one\\r\\nlong _strategic_ battle. Nevertheless, respecting Wagram, had the\\r\\nArchduke John, with his 40,000 men, turned up, as the Archduke had\\r\\nmore right to expect than Wellington had to expect Blucher, Waterloo\\r\\nmight have been antedated six years.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lasalle_ was a prime favourite of Napoleon, for his sure eye and\\r\\nactive bearing. His capture of Stettin with two regiments of hussars\\r\\nwas specially noteworthy. Like Lannes he had a strong premonition of\\r\\nhis death. Marbot tells a story of how Napoleon gave him 200,000\\r\\nfrancs to get married with. A week later the Emperor asked, \"When is\\r\\nthe wedding?\" \"As soon as I have got some money to furnish with,\\r\\nsire.\" \"Why, I gave you 200,000 francs to furnish with last week! What\\r\\nhave you done with them?\" \"Paid my debts with half, and lost the other\\r\\nhalf at cards.\" Such an admission would have ruined any other general.\\r\\nThe Emperor laughed, and merely giving a sharp tug at Lasalle\\'s\\r\\nmoustache, ordered Duroc to give him another 200,000.\\r\\n\\r\\n_I am sunburnt_, and, as he writes Cambaceres the same day, tired out,\\r\\nhaving been sixty out of the previous seventy-two hours in the\\r\\nsaddle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 12.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Wolkersdorf._--On July 8th he writes General Clarke: \"I have the\\r\\nheadquarters lately occupied by the craven Francis II., who contented\\r\\nhimself with watching the whole affair from the top of a tower, ten\\r\\nmiles from the scene of battle.\" On this day also he dictated his\\r\\ntwenty-fifth bulletin, of which the last portion is so skilfully\\r\\nutilised in the last scene of Act V. in L\\'Aiglon. One concluding\\r\\nsentence is all that can here be quoted: \"Such is the recital of the\\r\\nbattle of Wagram, a decisive and ever illustrious battle, where three\\r\\nto four hundred thousand men, twelve to fifteen hundred guns, fought\\r\\nfor great stakes on a field of battle, studied, meditated on, and\\r\\nfortified by the enemy for many months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_A surfeit of bile._--His usual source of relief after extra work or\\r\\nworry. In this case both. Bernadotte had behaved so badly at Wagram,\\r\\nthat Napoleon sent him to Paris with the stern rebuke, \"A bungler like\\r\\nyou is no good to me.\" But as usual his anger against an old comrade\\r\\nis short-lived, and he gives General Clarke permission to send\\r\\nBernadotte to command at Antwerp against the English.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 16.\\r\\n\\r\\n_My affairs follow my wishes._--In Austria, possibly, but not\\r\\nelsewhere. Prussia was seething with conspiracy, Russia with\\r\\nill-concealed hatred, the English had just landed in Belgium, and\\r\\nWellesley had just won Talavera. Soult was apparently no longer\\r\\ntrustworthy, Bernadotte a conceited boaster, who had to be publicly\\r\\nsnubbed (see The Order of the Day, August 5th, No. 15,614). Clarke and\\r\\nCambaceres are so slow that Napoleon writes them (August 10th) \"not to\\r\\nlet the English come and take you in bed.\" Fouche shows more energy\\r\\nthan every one else put together, calls out National Guards, and sends\\r\\nthem off to meet the northern invasion. The Minister of the Interior,\\r\\nM. Cretet, had just died, and the Emperor had wisely put Fouche, the\\r\\nmost competent man available, into his place for the time being.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 17.\\r\\n\\r\\n_August 21st._--The list of birthday honours (August 15th) had been a\\r\\nfairly long one, Berthier becoming Prince of Wagram, Massena of\\r\\nEssling, Davoust of Eckmuehl. Marshals Oudinot and Macdonald, Generals\\r\\nClarke, Reynier, Gaudin and Champagny, as also M. Maret, became Dukes.\\r\\nMarmont had already, says Savary, been made delirious with the joy of\\r\\npossessing a baton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 18.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Comedians._--Napoleon found relaxation more after his own heart in\\r\\nconversing with the savants of Germany, including the great mechanic\\r\\nMaeelzel, with whose automaton chess-player he played a game. Constant\\r\\ngives a highly-coloured picture of the sequel: \"The automaton was\\r\\nseated before a chess-board, and the Emperor, taking a chair opposite\\r\\nthe figure, said laughingly, \\'Now, my friend, we\\'ll have a game.\\' The\\r\\nautomaton, bowing, made signs for the Emperor to begin. After two or\\r\\nthree moves the Emperor made a wrong one on purpose; the automaton\\r\\nbowed and replaced the piece on the board. His Majesty cheated again,\\r\\nwhen the automaton bowed again, but this time took the pawn. \\'Quite\\r\\nright,\\' said his Majesty, as he promptly cheated for the third time.\\r\\nThe automaton then shook its head, and with one sweep of its hand\\r\\nknocked all the chessmen down.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Women ... not having been presented._--One woman, however, the\\r\\nmistress of Lord Paget, was quite willing to be presented at a late\\r\\nhour and to murder him at the same time--at least so says Constant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\n_All this is very suspicious._--For perfectly natural reasons Caesar\\'s\\r\\nwife was now above suspicion, but Caesar himself was not so. Madame\\r\\nWalewski had been more than a month at Schoenbrunn, and on May 4th,\\r\\n1810, Napoleon has a second son born, who fifty years later helped to\\r\\nedit his father\\'s _Correspondence_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 20.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Krems._--He left here to review Davoust\\'s corps on the field of\\r\\nAusterlitz. Afterwards all the generals dined with him, and the\\r\\nEmperor said, \"This is the second time I come upon the field of\\r\\nAusterlitz; shall I come to it a third time?\" \"Sire,\" replied one,\\r\\n\"from what we see every day none dare wager that you will not!\" It was\\r\\nthis suppressed hatred that probably determined the Emperor to\\r\\ndismantle the fortifications of Vienna, an act that intensified the\\r\\nhatred of the Viennese more than his allowing the poor people to help\\r\\nthemselves to wood for the winter in the imperial forests had\\r\\nmollified them.\\r\\n\\r\\n_My health has never been better._--His reason for this remark is\\r\\nfound in his letter to Cambaceres of the same date, \"They have spread\\r\\nin Paris the rumour that I was ill, I know not why; I was never\\r\\nbetter.\" The reason of the rumour was that Corvisart had been sent for\\r\\nto Vienna, as there had been an outbreak of dysentery among the\\r\\ntroops. This was kept a profound secret from France, and Napoleon even\\r\\nallowed Josephine to think that Corvisart had attended him (see Letter\\r\\n22).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 23.\\r\\n\\r\\n_October 14th._--Two days before, Stabs, the young Tugendbundist and\\r\\nan admirer of Joan of Arc, had attempted to assassinate Napoleon on\\r\\nparade with a carving-knife. The Emperor\\'s letter to Fouche of the\\r\\n12th October gives the most succinct account:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A youth of seventeen, son of a Lutheran minister of Erfurt, sought to\\r\\napproach me on parade to-day. He was arrested by the officers, and as\\r\\nthe little man\\'s agitation had been noticed, suspicion was aroused; he\\r\\nwas searched, and a dagger found upon him. I had him brought before\\r\\nme, and the little wretch, who seemed to me fairly well educated, told\\r\\nme that he wished to assassinate me to deliver Austria from the\\r\\npresence of the French. I could distinguish in him neither religious\\r\\nnor political fanaticism. He did not appear to know exactly who or\\r\\nwhat Brutus was. The fever of excitement he was in prevented our\\r\\nknowing more. He will be examined when he has cooled down and fasted.\\r\\nIt is possible that it will come to nothing. He will be arraigned\\r\\nbefore a military commission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wished to inform you of this circumstance in order that it may not\\r\\nbe made out more important than it appears to be. I hope it will not\\r\\nleak out; if it does, we shall have to represent the fellow as a\\r\\nmadman. If it is not spoken of at all, keep it to yourself. The whole\\r\\naffair made no disturbance at the parade; I myself saw nothing of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_P.S._--I repeat once more, and you understand clearly, that there is\\r\\nto be no discussion of this occurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCount Rapp saved the Emperor\\'s life on this occasion, and he, Savary,\\r\\nand Constant, all give detailed accounts. Their narratives are a\\r\\nremarkable object-lesson of the carelessness of the average\\r\\ncontemporary spectator in recording dates. Savary gives vaguely the\\r\\nend of September, Constant October 13th, and Count Rapp October 23rd.\\r\\nIn the present case the date of this otherwise trivial incident is\\r\\nimportant, for careless historians assert that it influenced Napoleon\\r\\nin concluding peace. In any case it would have taken twenty such\\r\\noccurrences to affect Napoleon one hairbreadth, and in the present\\r\\ninstance his letter of October 10th to the Russian Emperor proves that\\r\\nthe Peace was already settled--all but the signing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 24.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Stuttgard._--General Rapp describes this journey as follows: \"Peace\\r\\nwas ratified. We left Nymphenburg and arrived at Stuttgard. Napoleon\\r\\nwas received in a style of magnificence, and was lodged in the palace\\r\\ntogether with his suite. The King was laying out a spacious garden,\\r\\nand men who had been condemned to the galleys were employed to labour\\r\\nin it. The Emperor asked the King who the men were who worked in\\r\\nchains; he replied that they were for the most part rebels who had\\r\\nbeen taken in his new possessions. We set out on the following day. On\\r\\nthe way Napoleon alluded to the unfortunate wretches whom he had seen\\r\\nat Stuttgard. \\'The King of Wuertemberg,\\' said he, \\'is a very harsh man;\\r\\nbut he is very faithful. Of all the sovereigns in Europe he possesses\\r\\nthe greatest share of understanding.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We stopped for an hour at Rastadt, where the Princess of Baden and\\r\\nPrincess Stephanie had arrived for the purpose of paying their\\r\\nrespects to the Emperor. The Grand Duke and Duchess accompanied him as\\r\\nfar as Strasburg. On his arrival in that city he received despatches\\r\\nwhich again excited his displeasure against the Faubourg St. Germain.\\r\\nWe proceeded to Fontainebleau; no preparations had been made for the\\r\\nEmperor\\'s reception; there was not even a guard on duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was on October 26th, at 10 A.M. Meneval asserts that Napoleon\\'s\\r\\nsubsequent bad temper was feigned. In any case, the meeting--that\\r\\nmoment so impatiently awaited--was a very bad _quart d\\'heure_ for\\r\\nJosephine, accentuated doubtless by Fouche\\'s report of bad conduct on\\r\\nthe part of the ladies of St. Germain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [70] This Archduke was the \"international man\" at this juncture. Louis\\r\\n       Bonaparte speaks of a society at Saragossa, of which the object\\r\\n       was to make the Archduke Charles king of Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [71] These Adelphes or Philadelphes were the socialists or educated\\r\\n       anarchists of that day. They wished for the _statu quo_ before\\r\\n       Napoleon became supreme ruler. They had members in his army,\\r\\n       and it seems quite probable that Bernadotte gave them passive\\r\\n       support. General Oudet was their recognised head, and he died\\r\\n       under suspicious circumstances after Wagram. The society was,\\r\\n       unlike the Carbonari, anti-Catholic.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [72] Pelet, vol. i. 127.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [73] Pelet, vol. i. 282.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [74] \"Gaily asking his staff to breakfast with him\" (Pelet).\\r\\n\\r\\n  [75] Lejeune says \"some hours afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [76] Eugene\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [77] \"What a loss for France and for me,\" groaned Napoleon, as he left\\r\\n       his dead friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES M\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the _Correspondence of Napoleon I._, No. 16,058, the date\\r\\nof this letter is December 17th. It seems, however, possible that it\\r\\nis the letter written immediately after his arrival at Trianon,\\r\\nreferred to by Meneval, who was, in fact, responsible for it.\\r\\nThiers, working from unpublished memoirs of Hortense and Cambaceres,\\r\\ngives a most interesting account of the family council, held at 9\\r\\nP.M. on Friday, December 15th, at the Tuileries. Constant also\\r\\ndescribes the scene, but gives the Empress credit for showing the\\r\\nmost self-command of those chiefly interested. The next day, 11 A.M.,\\r\\nCount Lacepede introduced the resolutions of the family council to the\\r\\nSenatus-Consultus.[78] \"It is to-day that, more than ever before,\\r\\nthe Emperor has proved that he wishes to reign only to serve his\\r\\nsubjects, and that the Empress has merited that posterity should\\r\\nassociate her name with that of Napoleon.\" He pointed out that\\r\\nthirteen of Napoleon\\'s predecessors had broken the bonds of matrimony\\r\\nin order to fulfil better those of sovereign, and that among these\\r\\nwere the most admired and beloved of French monarchs--Charlemagne,\\r\\nPhilip Augustus, Louis XII. and Henry IV. This speech and the Decrees\\r\\n(carried by 76 votes to 7) are found in the _Moniteur_ of December\\r\\n17th, which Napoleon considers sufficiently authentic to send to his\\r\\nbrother Joseph as a full account of what occurred, and with no\\r\\nfurther comment of his own but that it was the step which he thought\\r\\nit his duty to take. The Decrees of the Committee of the Senate\\r\\nwere:--\"(1) The marriage contracted between the Emperor Napoleon and\\r\\nthe Empress Josephine is dissolved. (2) The Empress Josephine will\\r\\nretain the titles and rank of a crowned Empress-Queen.[79] (3) Her\\r\\njointure is fixed at an annual revenue of L80,000 from the public\\r\\ntreasury.[80] (4) Every provision which may be made by the Emperor\\r\\nin favour of the Empress Josephine, out of the funds of the Civil\\r\\nList, shall be obligatory on his successors.\" They added separate\\r\\naddresses to the Emperor and Empress, and that to the latter seems\\r\\nworthy of quotation:--\"Your Imperial and Royal Majesty is about\\r\\nto make for France the greatest of sacrifices; history will preserve\\r\\nthe memory of it for ever. The august spouse of the greatest of\\r\\nmonarchs cannot be united to his immortal glory by more heroic\\r\\ndevotion. For long, Madame, the French people has revered your\\r\\nvirtues; it holds dear that loving kindness which inspires your every\\r\\nword, as it directs your every action; it will admire your sublime\\r\\ndevotion; it will award for ever to your Majesty, Empress and\\r\\nQueen, the homage of gratitude, respect, and love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a letter of Eugene\\'s to his wife, quoted by Aubenas, it\\r\\nappears that he, with his mother, arrived at Malmaison on Saturday\\r\\nevening,[81] December 16th, and that it never ceased raining all\\r\\nthe next day, which added to the general depression, in spite of, or\\r\\nbecause of, Eugene\\'s bad puns. On the evening of the 16th Napoleon\\r\\nwas at Trianon, writing letters, and we cannot think that if the\\r\\nEmperor had been to Malmaison on the Sunday,[82] Eugene would have\\r\\nincluded this without comment in the \"some visits\" they had\\r\\nreceived. The Emperor, as we see from the next letter, paid\\r\\nJosephine a visit on the Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date of this is Tuesday, December 19th, while No. 3 is Wednesday\\r\\nthe 20th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Savary_, always unpopular with the Court ladies, has now nothing but\\r\\nkind words for Josephine. \"She quitted the Court, but the Court did\\r\\nnot quit her; it had always loved her, for never had any one been so\\r\\nkind.... She never injured any one in the time of her power; she\\r\\nprotected even her enemies\"--such as Fouche at this juncture, and\\r\\nLucien earlier. \"During her stay at Malmaison, the highroad from Paris\\r\\nto this chateau was only one long procession, in spite of the bad\\r\\nweather; every one considered it a duty to present themselves at least\\r\\nonce a week.\" Later, Marie Louise became jealous of this, and poor\\r\\nJosephine had to go to the chateau of Navarre, and finally to leave\\r\\nFrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Queen of Naples._--For some reason Napoleon had not wanted this\\r\\nsister at Paris this winter, and had written her to this effect from\\r\\nSchoenbrunn on October 15th. \"If you were not so far off, and the\\r\\nseason so advanced, I would have asked Murat to spend two months in\\r\\nParis. But you cannot be there before December, which is a horrible\\r\\nseason, especially for a Neapolitan.\"[83] But sister Caroline, \"with\\r\\nthe head of a Cromwell on the shoulders of a pretty woman,\" was not\\r\\neasy to lead; and her husband had in consequence to bear the full\\r\\nweight of the Emperor\\'s displeasure. Murat\\'s finances were in\\r\\ndisorder, and Napoleon wrote Champagny on December 30th to tell Murat\\r\\nplainly that if the borrowed money was not returned to France, it\\r\\nwould be taken by main force.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\n_The hunt._--In pouring rain, in the forest of St. Germain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday, December 21st, is the date.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The weather is very damp._--Making Malmaison as unhealthy as its\\r\\nvery name warranted, and rendering more difficult the task which\\r\\nMadame de Remusat had set herself of resting Josephine mentally by\\r\\ntiring her physically. This typical toady--Napoleon\\'s Eavesdropper\\r\\nExtraordinary--had arrived at Malmaison on December 18th. She\\r\\nwrites on the Friday (December 22nd), beseeching her husband to\\r\\nadvise the Emperor to moderate the tone of his letters, especially\\r\\nthis one (Thursday, December 21st), which had upset Josephine\\r\\nfrightfully. Surely a more harmless letter was never penned. But\\r\\nit is the Remusat all over; she lives in a chronic atmosphere of\\r\\nsuspicion that all her letters are read by the Emperor, and\\r\\ntherefore, like Stevenson\\'s nursery rhymes, they are always written\\r\\nwith \"one eye on the grown-up person\"[85]--on the grown-up person\\r\\n_par excellence_ of France and the century. The opening of letters by\\r\\nthe government was doubtless a blemish, which, however, Napoleon\\r\\ntried to neutralise by entrusting the Post Office to his wife\\'s\\r\\nrelative, Lavalette, a man whose ever-kind heart prevented this\\r\\nnecessary espionage degenerating into unnecessary interference\\r\\nwith individual rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nDate probably Sunday, December 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_King of Bavaria._--Eugene had gone to Meaux to meet his father-in-law,\\r\\nwho had put off the \"dog\\'s humour\" which he had shown since the 16th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine had gone by special invitation to dine at the little Trianon\\r\\nwith Napoleon on Christmas Day, and Madame d\\'Avrillon says she had a\\r\\nvery happy day there. \"On her return she told me how kind the Emperor\\r\\nhad been to her, that he had kept her all the evening, saying the\\r\\nkindest things to her.\" Aubenas says, \"The repast was eaten in silence\\r\\nand gloom,\" but does not give his authority. Eugene, moreover,\\r\\nconfirms Madame d\\'Avrillon in his letter to his wife of December 26th:\\r\\n\"My dear Auguste, the Emperor came on Sunday to see the Empress.\\r\\nYesterday she went to Trianon to see him, and stayed to dinner. The\\r\\nEmperor was very kind and amiable to her, and she seemed to be much\\r\\nbetter. Everything points to the Empress being more happy in her new\\r\\nposition, and we also.\" On this Christmas Day Napoleon had his last\\r\\nmeal with Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tuileries._--His return from Trianon to this, his official residence,\\r\\nmade the divorce more apparent to every one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\n_A house vacant in Paris._--This seems a hint for Josephine. She\\r\\nwishes to come to Paris, to the Elysee, and to try a little diplomacy\\r\\nof her own in favour of the Austrian match, and she sends secretly to\\r\\nMadame de Metternich--whose husband was absent. Eugene more officially\\r\\nis approaching Prince Schwartzenberg, the ambassador. Josephine, like\\r\\nTalleyrand, wished to heal the schism with Rome by an Austrian\\r\\nalliance; while Cambaceres, foreseeing a war with the power not allied\\r\\nby marriage, would have preferred the Russian match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday, January 4th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hortense._--Louis had tried to obtain a divorce. Cambaceres was\\r\\nordered on December 22nd to summon a family council (_New Letters of\\r\\nNapoleon I._, No. 234); but the wish of the King was refused\\r\\n(verbally, says Louis in his _Historical Documents of Holland_),\\r\\nwhereupon he refused to agree to Josephine\\'s divorce, but had to give\\r\\nway, and was present at what he calls the farewell festival given by\\r\\nthe city of Paris to the Empress Josephine on January 1st. The\\r\\necclesiastical divorce was pronounced on January 12th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 5th. He duly visits Josephine the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 7th is the date.\\r\\n\\r\\n_What charms your society has._--Her repertoire of small talk and\\r\\nscandal. He had also lost in her his Agenda, his Journal of Paris.\\r\\nStill the visits are growing rarer. This long kind letter was\\r\\ndoubtless intended to be specially so, for two days later the clergy\\r\\nof Paris pronounced the annulment of her marriage. This was far worse\\r\\nthan the pronouncement by the Senate in December, as it meant to her\\r\\nthat she and Napoleon had never been properly married at all. The\\r\\nEmperor, who hated divorces, and especially _divorcees_, had found\\r\\ngreat difficulty in breaking down the barriers he had helped to build,\\r\\nfor which purpose _he_ had to be subordinated to his own Senate, _the\\r\\nPope_ to his own bishops. Seven of them allowed the annulment of the\\r\\nmarriage of 1804 on account of (1) its secrecy, (2) the insufficiency\\r\\nof consent of the contracting parties, and (3) the absence of the\\r\\nlocal parish priest at the ceremony. The last reason was merely a\\r\\ntechnical one; but with respect to the first two it is only fair to\\r\\nadmit that Napoleon had undoubtedly, and perhaps for the only time in\\r\\nhis life, been completely \"rushed,\" _i.e._ by the Pope and Josephine.\\r\\nThe coronation ceremony was waiting, and the Pope, secretly solicited\\r\\nby Josephine, insisted on a religious marriage first and foremost. The\\r\\nPope suffered forthwith, but the other bill of costs was not exacted\\r\\ntill five years after date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nWednesday, January 12th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_King of Westphalia._--Madame Durand (_Napoleon and Marie Louise_)\\r\\nsays that, forced to abandon his wife (the beautiful and energetic\\r\\nMiss Paterson) and child, Jerome \"had vowed he would never have any\\r\\nrelations with a wife who had been thus forced upon him.\" For three\\r\\nyears he lavished his attentions upon almost all the beauties of the\\r\\nWestphalian court. The queen, an eye-witness of this conduct, bore it\\r\\nwith mild and forbearing dignity; she seemed to see and hear nothing;\\r\\nin short, her demeanour was perfect. The king, touched by her\\r\\ngoodness, weary of his conquests, and repentant of his behaviour, was\\r\\nonly anxious for an opportunity of altering the state of things.\\r\\nHappily the propitious moment presented itself. The right wing of the\\r\\npalace of Cassel, in which the queen\\'s apartments were situated, took\\r\\nfire; alarmed by the screams of her women the queen awoke and sprang\\r\\nout of her bed, to be caught in the arms of the king and carried to a\\r\\nplace of safety. From that time forth the royal couple were united and\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaturday, January 13th.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Sensible._--This was now possible after a month\\'s mourning. In the\\r\\nearly days, according to Madame Remusat, her mind often wandered, But\\r\\nNapoleon himself encouraged the Court to visit her, and the road to\\r\\nMalmaison was soon a crowded one. As the days passed, however, life\\r\\nbecame sadly monotonous. Reading palled on Josephine, as did whist and\\r\\nthe daily feeding of her golden pheasants and guinea-fowls. Remained\\r\\n\"Patience\"! Was it the \"General\" she played or the \"Emperor,\" or did\\r\\nshe find distraction in the \"Demon\"?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 14.\\r\\n\\r\\n_D\\'Audenarde._--Napoleon\\'s handsome equerry, whom Mlle. d\\'Avrillon\\r\\ncalls \"un homme superbe.\" His mother was Josephine\\'s favourite _dame\\r\\ndu palais_. Madame Lalaing, Viscountess d\\'Audenarde, _nee_ Peyrac, was\\r\\none of the old regime who had been ruined by the Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuesday, January 23rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 21st a Privy Council was summoned to approve of Marie\\r\\nLouise as their \"choice of a consort, who may give an heir to the\\r\\nthrone\" (Thiers). Cambaceres, Fouche, and Murat wished for the Russian\\r\\nprincess; Lebrun, Cardinal Fesch, and King Louis for a Saxon one; but\\r\\nTalleyrand, Champagny, Maret, Berthier, Fontanes were for Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 17.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday, January 28th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 18.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine had heard she was to be banished from Paris, and so had\\r\\nasked to come to the Elysee to prove the truth or otherwise of the\\r\\nrumour.\\r\\n\\r\\n_L\\'Elysee._--St. Amand gives the following interesting _precis_:\\r\\n\"Built by the Count d\\'Evreux in 1718, it had belonged in succession to\\r\\nthe Marchioness de Pompadour, to the financier Beaujon, a Croesus of\\r\\nthe eighteenth century, and to the Duchesse de Bourbon. Having, under\\r\\nthe Revolution, become national property, it had been hired by the\\r\\ncaterers of public entertainments, who gave it the name of L\\'Elysee.\\r\\nIn 1803 it became the property of Murat, who, becoming King of Naples,\\r\\nceded it to Napoleon in 1808. Here Napoleon signed his second\\r\\nabdication, here resided Alexander I. in 1815, and here Josephine\\'s\\r\\ngrandson effected the _Coup d\\'Etat_ (1851). When the Senatus-Consultus\\r\\nfixed the revenue of Josephine, Napoleon not only gave her whatever\\r\\nrights he had in Malmaison, viz., at least 90 per cent. of the total\\r\\ncost, but the palace of the Elysee, its gardens and dependencies, with\\r\\nthe furniture then in use.\" The latter residence was, however, for her\\r\\nlife only.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 3rd is the date.\\r\\n\\r\\n_L\\'Elysee._--After the first receptions the place is far worse than\\r\\nMalmaison. Schwartzenberg, Talleyrand, the Princess Pauline, Berthier,\\r\\neven her old friend Cambaceres are giving balls,[86] while the Emperor\\r\\ngoes nearly every night to a theatre. The carriages pass by the\\r\\nElysee, but do not stop. \"It is as if the palace were in quarantine,\\r\\nwith the yellow flag floating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 20.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Bessieres\\' country-house._--M. Masson says Grignon, but unless this\\r\\nhouse is called after the chateau of that name in Provence, he must be\\r\\nmistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 21.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Rambouillet._--He had taken the Court with him, and was there from\\r\\nFebruary 19th to the 23rd, the date of this letter. While there he had\\r\\nbeen in the best of humours. On his return he finds it necessary to\\r\\nwrite his future wife and to her father--and to pen a legible letter\\r\\nto the latter gives him far more trouble than winning a battle against\\r\\nthe Austrians, if not assisted by General Danube.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Adieu._--Sick and weary, Josephine returns to Malmaison, Friday,\\r\\nMarch 9th, and even this is not long to be hers, for the new Empress\\r\\nis almost already on her way. The marriage at Vienna took place on\\r\\nMarch 11th, with her uncle Charles,[87] the hero of Essling, for\\r\\nNapoleon\\'s proxy; on the 13th she leaves Vienna, and on the 23rd\\r\\nreaches Strasbourg. On the 27th she meets Napoleon at Compiegne,\\r\\nspends three days with him in the chateau there, and arrives at St.\\r\\nCloud on April 1st, where the civil marriage is renewed, followed by\\r\\nthe triumphal entry into Paris, and the religious ceremony on April\\r\\n2nd. This day Josephine reaches the chateau of Navarre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [78] By here subordinating himself to the Senate, the Emperor was\\r\\n       preparing a rod for his own back hereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [79] This clause gives considerable trouble to Lacepede and Regnauld.\\r\\n       They cannot even find a precedent whether, if they met,\\r\\n       Josephine or Marie Louise would take precedence of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [80] In addition to this, Napoleon gives her L40,000 a year from his\\r\\n       privy purse, but keeps most of it back for the first two years\\r\\n       to pay her 120 creditors. (For interesting details see Masson,\\r\\n       _Josephine Repudiee_.)\\r\\n\\r\\n  [81] Which agrees with Madame d\\'Avrillon, who says they left the\\r\\n       Tuileries at 2.30. Meneval says Napoleon left for Trianon a few\\r\\n       hours later. Savary writes erroneously that they left the\\r\\n       following morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [82] M.

At\\r\\nthe time of the Revolution it belonged to the Dukes of Bouillon, and\\r\\nwas confiscated. In February 1810, Napoleon determined to purchase it,\\r\\nand on March 10th instructed his secretary of state, Maret, to confer\\r\\nthe Duchy of Navarre, purchased by letters patent, on Josephine and\\r\\nher heirs male. The old square building was, however, utterly unfit to\\r\\nbe inhabited: not a window would shut, there was neither paper nor\\r\\ntapestry, all the wainscoting was rotten, draughts and damp\\r\\neverywhere, and no heating apparatus.[88] What solace to know its\\r\\nbeautiful situation, its capabilities? No wonder if her household,\\r\\nbanished to such a place, sixty-five miles from the \"capital of\\r\\ncapitals,\" should rebel, and secessions headed by Madame Ney become\\r\\nfor a time general. Whist and piquet soon grow stale in such a house\\r\\nand with such surroundings, and even _trictrac_ with the old bishop of\\r\\nEvreux becomes tedious. Eugene as usual brings sunshine in his path,\\r\\nand helps to dispel the gloom caused by the idle gossip imported from\\r\\nParis--that Josephine is not to return to Malmaison, and the like.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Josephine\\'s second letter, says D\\'Avrillon, the first being\\r\\nanswered _viva voce_ by Eugene.\\r\\n\\r\\n_To Malmaison._--Napoleon had promised Josephine permission to return\\r\\nto Malmaison, and would not recant: his new wife was, however, very\\r\\njealous of Josephine, and very much hurt at her presence at Malmaison.\\r\\nNapoleon managed to be away from Paris for six weeks after Josephine\\'s\\r\\narrival at Malmaison.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1A.\\r\\n\\r\\n_It is written in a bad style._--M. Masson, however, is loud in\\r\\nits praises, and adds, \"Voila donc le protocol du tutoiement\"\\r\\nre-established between them in spite of the second marriage, and\\r\\ntheir correspondence re-established on the old terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter seems to have been taken by Eugene to Paris, and thence\\r\\nforwarded to the Emperor with a letter from that Prince in which he\\r\\nenumerates Josephine\\'s suggestions and wishes--(1) that she will not\\r\\ngo to Aix-la-Chapelle if other waters are suggested by Corvisart;\\r\\n(2) that after stopping a few days at Malmaison she will go in June\\r\\nfor three months to the baths, and afterwards to the south of\\r\\nFrance; visit Rome, Florence, and Naples incognito, spend the winter\\r\\nat Milan, and return to Malmaison and Navarre in the spring of\\r\\n1811; (3) that in her absence Navarre shall be made habitable, for\\r\\nwhich fresh funds are required; (4) that Josephine wishes her\\r\\ncousins the Taschers to marry, one a relative of King Joseph, the\\r\\nother the Princess Amelie de la Leyen, niece of the Prince Primate.\\r\\nTo this Napoleon replies from Compiegne, April 26th, that the De Leyen\\r\\nmatch with Louis Tascher may take place,[89] but that he will not\\r\\ninterest himself in the other (Henry) Tascher, who is giddy-headed\\r\\nand bad-tempered. \"I consent to whatever the Empress does, but I will\\r\\nnot confer any mark of my regard on a person who has behaved ill\\r\\nto me. I am very glad that the Empress likes Navarre. I am giving\\r\\norders to have L12,000 which I owe her for 1810, and L12,000 for 1811\\r\\nadvanced to her. She will then have only the L80,000 from the public\\r\\ntreasury to come in.... She is free to go to whatever spa she cares\\r\\nfor, and even to return to Paris afterwards.\" He thinks, however, she\\r\\nwould be happier in new scenes which they had never visited together,\\r\\nas they had Aix-la-Chapelle. If, however, the last are the best she\\r\\nmay go to them, for \"what I desire above all is that she may keep\\r\\ncalm, and not allow herself to be excited by the gossip of Paris.\"\\r\\nThis letter goes far to soothe the poor chatelaine of Navarre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2A.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Two letters._--The other, now missing, may have some reference to the\\r\\npictures to which he refers in his letter to Fouche the next day. \"Is\\r\\nit true that engravings are being published with the title of\\r\\n_Josephine Beauharnais nee La Pagerie_? If this is true, have the\\r\\nprints seized, and let the engravers be punished\" (_New Letters_, No.\\r\\n253).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably written from Boulogne about the 25th. His northern tour\\r\\nwith Marie Louise had been very similar to one taken in 1804,\\r\\nbut his _entourage_ found the new bride very cold and callous\\r\\ncompared to Josephine. Leaving Paris on April 29th Napoleon\\'s\\r\\n_Correspondence_ till June is dated Laeken (April 30th); Antwerp\\r\\n(May 3rd); Bois-le-Duc; Middleburg, Gand, Bruges, Ostend (May\\r\\n20th); Lille, Boulogne, Dieppe, Le Havre, Rouen (May 31st). He\\r\\ntakes the Empress in a canal barge from Brussels to Malines and\\r\\nhimself descends the subterranean vault of the Escaut-Oise canal,\\r\\nbetween St. Quentin and Cambrai. He is at St. Cloud on June 2nd.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine has felt his wanderings less, as she has the future\\r\\nEmperor, her favourite grandson, with her, the little Oui-Oui, as she\\r\\ncalls him, and for whom the damp spring weather of Holland was\\r\\ndangerous. She was also at Malmaison from the middle of May to June\\r\\n18th. The original collection of _Letters_ (Didot Freres, 1833) heads\\r\\nthe letter correctly to the Empress Josephine at _Malmaison_, but the\\r\\n_Correspondence_, published by order of Napoleon III., gives it\\r\\nerroneously, to the Empress Josephine, _at the Chateau of Navarre_\\r\\n(No. 16,537).\\r\\n\\r\\n_I will come to see you._--He comes for two hours on June 13th, and\\r\\nmakes himself thoroughly agreeable. Poor Josephine is light-headed\\r\\nwith joy all the evening after. The meeting of the two Empresses\\r\\nis, however, indefinitely postponed, and Josephine had now no\\r\\nfurther reason to delay her departure. Leaving her little grandson\\r\\nLouis behind, she travels under the name of the Countess d\\'Arberg,\\r\\nand she is accompanied by Madame d\\'Audenarde and Mlle. de Mackau, who\\r\\nleft the Princess Stephanie to come to Navarre. M. Masson notes that\\r\\nMadame de Remusat needs the Aix waters, and will rejoin Josephine\\r\\n(within a week), under pretext of service, and thus obtain her\\r\\ncure gratuitously. They go _via_ Lyons and Geneva to Aix-les-Bains.\\r\\nM. Masson, who has recently made a careful and complete study of\\r\\nthis period, describes the daily round. \"Josephine, on getting out\\r\\nof bed, takes conscientiously her baths and douches, then, as usual,\\r\\nlies down again until _dejeuner_, 11 A.M., for which the whole of the\\r\\nlittle Court are assembled at _The Palace_--wherever she lives, and\\r\\nhowever squalid the dwelling-place, her abode always bears this name.\\r\\nAfterwards she and her women-folk ply their interminable tapestry,\\r\\nwhile the latest novel or play (sent by Barbier from Paris) is read\\r\\naloud. And so the day passes till five, when they dress for dinner at\\r\\nsix; after dinner a ride. At nine the Empress\\'s friends assemble in\\r\\nher room, Mlle. de Mackau sings; at eleven every one goes to bed.\"\\r\\nThis programme, however, varies with the weather. Here is St.\\r\\nAmand\\'s version (_Dernieres Annees de l\\'Imperatrice Josephine_, p.\\r\\n237): \"A little reading in the morning, an airing (_le promenade_)\\r\\nafterwards, dinner at eight on account of the heat, games afterwards,\\r\\nand some little music; so passed existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n_July 8th._--On July 5th, driving along the Chambery road, Josephine\\r\\nmet the courier with a letter from Eugene describing the terrible fire\\r\\nat Prince Schwartzenberg\\'s ball, where the Princess de la Leyen,\\r\\nmother of young Taschre\\'s bride-elect, was burnt. It is noteworthy\\r\\nthat the Emperor makes no allusion to the conflagration. As, however,\\r\\nthis is the first letter since the end of May, others may have been\\r\\nlost or destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n_You will have seen Eugene_--_i.e._ on his way to Milan, who arrived\\r\\nat Aix on July 10th. He had just been made heir to the Grand Duchy of\\r\\nFrankfort--a broad hint to him and to Europe that Italy would be\\r\\neventually united to France under Napoleon\\'s dynasty. This was the\\r\\nnadir of the Beauharnais family--Josephine _repudiee_, Hortense\\r\\nunqueened and unwed,[90] and Eugene\\'s expectations dissipated, and all\\r\\nwithin a few short months. Eugene had left his wife ill at Geneva,\\r\\nwhither Josephine goes to visit her the next day, duly reporting her\\r\\nvisit to Napoleon in her letter of July 14th (see No. 5). Geneva was\\r\\nalways the home of the disaffected, and so the Empress had to be\\r\\nspecially tactful, and the De Remusat reports: \"She speaks of the\\r\\nEmperor as of a brother, of the new Empress as the one who will give\\r\\nchildren to France, and if the rumours of the latter\\'s condition be\\r\\ncorrect, I am certain she will be delighted about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_That unfortunate daughter is coming to France_--_i.e._ to reside when\\r\\nshe is not at St. Leu (given to her by Napoleon) or at the waters. On\\r\\nthe present occasion she has been at Plombieres a month or more. On\\r\\nJuly 10th Napoleon instructs the Countess de Boubers to bring the\\r\\nGrand Duke of Berg to Paris, \"whom he awaits with impatience\"\\r\\n(_Brotonne_, 625).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The conduct of the King of Holland has worried me._--This was in\\r\\nMarch, and by May the crisis was still more acute and Napoleon\\'s\\r\\npatience exhausted. On May 20th he writes: \"Before all things be a\\r\\nFrenchman and the Emperor\\'s brother, and then you may be sure you are\\r\\nin the path of the true interests of Holland. Good sense and policy\\r\\nare necessary to the government of states, not sour unhealthy bile.\"\\r\\nAnd three days later: \"Write me no more of your customary twaddle;\\r\\nthree years now it has been going on, and every instant proves its\\r\\nfalsehood! This is the last letter I shall ever write you in my\\r\\nlife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis at one time determined on war, and rather than surrender\\r\\nAmsterdam, to cut the dykes. The Emperor hears of this, summons his\\r\\nbrother, and practically imprisons him until he countermands the\\r\\ndefence of Amsterdam.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 1st Louis abdicated and fled to Toeplitz in Bohemia. Napoleon\\r\\nis terribly grieved at the conduct of his brother, who would never\\r\\nrealise that the effective Continental blockade was Napoleon\\'s last\\r\\nsheet-anchor to force peace upon England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n_To die in a lake_--_i.e._ the Lake of Bourget, shut in by the Dent du\\r\\nChat, where a white squall had nearly capsized the sailing boat.\\r\\nJosephine had been on July 26th to visit the abbey Haute-Combe, place\\r\\nof sepulture of the Princes of Savoy, and the storm had overtaken her\\r\\non the return voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Paris, this Friday._--A very valuable note of M. Masson (_Josephine\\r\\nRepudiee_, 198) enables us to fix this letter at its correct date. He\\r\\nsays: \"It has to do with the exile of Madame de la T---- (viz., the\\r\\nPrincess Louis de la Tremoille), which takes place on September 28th,\\r\\n1810, and this 28th September is also a Friday: there is also the\\r\\nquestion of Mlle. de Mackau being made a baroness\" (and this lady had\\r\\nnot joined the Court of Josephine till May 1810); \"lastly, the B----\\r\\nmentioned therein can only be Barante, the Prefect, whose dismissal\\r\\n(from Geneva) almost coincides with this letter.\" It may be added\\r\\nthat the La Tremoille family was one of the oldest in France, allied\\r\\nwith the Condes, and consequently with the Bourbons. Barante\\'s fault\\r\\nhad been connivance at the letters and conduct of Madame de Stael.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The only suitable places ... are either Milan or Navarre._--Milan had\\r\\nbeen her own suggestion conveyed by Eugene, but Napoleon, two months\\r\\nlater, had told her she could spend the winter in France, and in spite\\r\\nof danger signals (\"inspired by diplomacy rather than devotion\" [91])\\r\\nfrom Madame de Remusat (in her fulsome and tedious \"despatch\" sent\\r\\nfrom Paris in September, and probably inspired by the Emperor himself)\\r\\nshe manages to get to Navarre, and even to spend the first fortnight\\r\\nof November at Malmaison. Before leaving Switzerland Josephine refuses\\r\\nto risk an interview with Madame de Stael. \"In the first book she\\r\\npublishes she will not fail to report our conversation, and heaven\\r\\nknows how many things she will make me say that I have never even\\r\\nthought of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the heading Josephine was at Malmaison on this day, and\\r\\nNapoleon writes Cambaceres: \"My cousin, the Empress Josephine not\\r\\nleaving for Navarre till Monday or Tuesday, I wish you to pay her a\\r\\nvisit. You will let me know on your return how you find her\"\\r\\n(_Brotonne_,721). The real reason is to hasten her departure, and she\\r\\ngets to Navarre November 22nd (Thursday).\\r\\n\\r\\n_The Empress progresses satisfactorily._--Napoleon writes to this\\r\\neffect to her father, the Emperor of Austria, on the same day: \"The\\r\\nEmpress is very well.... It is impossible that the wife for whom I am\\r\\nindebted to you should be more perfect. Moreover, I beg your Majesty\\r\\nto rest assured that she and I are equally attached to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [87] On this occasion Baron Lejeune sees the Archduke Charles, and\\r\\n       remarks: \"There was nothing in his quiet face with its grave\\r\\n       and gentle expression, or in his simple, modest, unassuming\\r\\n       manner, to denote the mighty man of war; but no one who met his\\r\\n       eyes could doubt him to be a genius.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [88] \"This gloomy and forsaken chateau,\" says St. Amand, \"whose only\\r\\n       attraction was the half-forgotten memory of its vanished\\r\\n       splendours, was a fit image of the woman who came to seek\\r\\n       sanctuary there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [89] He endows the husband with L4000 a year, and the title of Count\\r\\n       Tascher.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [90] \"Une epouse sans epoux, et une reine sans royaume\"--St. Amand.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [91] Aubenas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES O\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The New Year._--On this occasion, instead of her usual gifts\\r\\n(_etrennes_) she organised a lottery of jewels, of which Madame\\r\\nDucrest gives a full account. Needless to say, Josephine worked the\\r\\noracle so that every one got a suitable gift--including the old Bishop\\r\\n(see next note).\\r\\n\\r\\n_More women than men._--The Bishop of Evreux (Mgr. Bourlier) was the\\r\\nmost welcome guest. He amused Josephine, and although eighty years of\\r\\nage, could play _trictrac_ and talk well on any subject. Madame de\\r\\nRemusat wrote her husband concerning him, \"We understand each other\\r\\nvery well, he and I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Keep well._--At Navarre Josephine lost her headaches, and put on\\r\\nflesh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a full account of the birth of the King of Rome in Napoleon\\'s\\r\\nletter to the Emperor of Austria on March 20 (No. 17,496). The letter\\r\\nof this date to Josephine is missing, but is referred to by\\r\\nD\\'Avrillon. It began, \"My dear Josephine, I have a son. I am _au\\r\\ncomble de bonheur_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Eugene._--Josephine much appreciated this allusion. \"Is it possible,\"\\r\\nshe said, \"for any one to be kinder than the Emperor, and more anxious\\r\\nto mitigate whatever might be painful for me at the present moment, if\\r\\nI loved him less sincerely? This association of my son with his own is\\r\\nwell worthy of him who, when he likes, is the most fascinating of all\\r\\nmen.\" She gave a costly ring to the page who brought the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the previous day Eugene had arrived at Navarre,--sent by the\\r\\nEmperor. \"You are going to see your mother, Eugene; tell her I am sure\\r\\nthat she will rejoice more than any one at my happiness. I should have\\r\\nalready written to her if I had not been absorbed by the pleasure of\\r\\nwatching my boy. The moments I snatch from his side are only for\\r\\nmatters of urgent necessity. This event, I shall acquit myself of the\\r\\nmost pleasant of them all by writing to Josephine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten in November 1811.\\r\\n\\r\\n_As fat as a good Normandy farmeress._--Madame d\\'Abrantes, who saw her\\r\\nabout this time, writes: \"I observed that Josephine had grown very\\r\\nstout[92] since the time of my departure for Spain. This change was at\\r\\nonce for the better and the worse. It imparted a more youthful\\r\\nappearance to her face; but her slender and elegant figure, which had\\r\\nbeen one of her principal attractions, had entirely disappeared. She\\r\\nhad now decided _embonpoint_, and her figure had assumed that matronly\\r\\nair which we find in the statues of Agrippina, Cornelia, &c. Still,\\r\\nhowever, she looked uncommonly well, and she wore a dress which became\\r\\nher admirably. Her judicious taste in these matters contributed to\\r\\nmake her appear young much longer than she otherwise would. The best\\r\\nproof of the admirable taste of Josephine is the marked absence of\\r\\nelegance shown by Marie Louise, though both Empresses employed the\\r\\nsame milliners and dressmakers, and Marie Louise had a large sum\\r\\nallotted for the expenses of her toilet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Amand says that 1811 was for Josephine a happy year, compared to\\r\\nthose which followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSERIES P\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten from Konigsberg (M. Masson, in _Josephine Repudiee_, says\\r\\nDantzig; but on June 11th Napoleon writes to Eugene, \"I shall be at\\r\\nKonigsberg to-morrow,\" where his correspondence is dated from\\r\\nhenceforward). A day or two later he writes the King of Rome\\'s\\r\\ngoverness that he trusts to hear soon that the fifteen months old\\r\\nchild has cut his first four teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Gumbinnen, June 20th._--From this place and on this date goes forth\\r\\nthe first bulletin of the _Grande Armee_. It gives a _resume_ of the\\r\\ncauses of the war, dating from the end of 1810, when English influence\\r\\nagain gained ascendency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 29th he writes Hortense from Witepsk to congratulate her on\\r\\nher eldest son\\'s recovery from an illness. A week later he writes his\\r\\nlibrarian for some amusing novels--new ones for choice, or old ones\\r\\nthat he has not read--or good memoirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nJosephine meanwhile has permission to go to Italy. Owing to her\\r\\ngrandson\\'s illness she defers starting till July 16th. Through\\r\\nfrightful weather she reaches Milan _via_ Geneva on July 28th, and has\\r\\na splendid reception. On the 29th she writes to Hortense: \"I have\\r\\nfound the three letters from Eugene, the last one dated the 13th; his\\r\\nhealth is excellent. He still pursues the Russians, without being able\\r\\nto overtake them. It is generally hoped the campaign may be a short\\r\\none. May that hope be realised!\" Two days later she announces the\\r\\nbirth of Eugene\\'s daughter Amelia, afterwards Empress of Brazil.\\r\\nTowards the end of August Josephine goes to Aix and meets the Queen of\\r\\nSpain with her sister Desiree Bernadotte, the former \"kind and amiable\\r\\nas usual,\" the latter \"very gracious to me\"--rather a new experience.\\r\\nFrom Aix she goes to Pregny-la-Tour, on the Lake of Geneva, and shocks\\r\\nthe good people in various ways, says M. Masson, especially by\\r\\ninnuendoes against Napoleon; and he adds, \"if one traces back to their\\r\\nsource the worst calumnies against the morals of the Emperor, it is\\r\\nJosephine that one encounters there.\" She gets to Malmaison October\\r\\n24th. Soon after his return from Moscow Napoleon pays her a visit, and\\r\\nabout this time she begins to see the King of Rome, whose mother has\\r\\nalways thought more of her daily music and drawing lessons than of\\r\\nwhether she was making her son happy or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n1812 closed in gloom, but 1813 was in itself terribly ominous to so\\r\\nsuperstitious a woman as Josephine. Thirteen is always unlucky, and\\r\\nmoreover the numbers of 1813 add up to 13; also the doom-dealing year\\r\\nbegan on a Friday. Every one felt the hour approaching. As Napoleon\\r\\nsaid at St. Helena: \"The star grew pale; I felt the reins slipping\\r\\nfrom my hand, and I could do no more. A thunderbolt could alone have\\r\\nsaved us, and every day, by some new fatality or other, our chances\\r\\ndiminished. Sinister designs began to creep in among us; fatigue and\\r\\ndiscouragement had won over the majority; my lieutenants became lax,\\r\\nclumsy, careless, and consequently unfortunate; they were no longer\\r\\nthe men of the commencement of the Revolution, nor even of the time of\\r\\nmy good fortune. The chief generals were sick of the war; I had gorged\\r\\nthem too much with my high esteem, with too many honours and too much\\r\\nwealth. They had drunk from the cup of pleasure, and wished to enjoy\\r\\npeace at any price. _The sacred fire was quenched._\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to August Fortune had smiled again upon her favourite. With\\r\\nconscripts for infantry and without cavalry he had won Lutzen,\\r\\nBautzen, and Dresden; and even so late as September Byron was writing\\r\\nthat \"bar epilepsy and the elements he would back Napoleon against the\\r\\nfield.\" But treachery and incompetence had undermined the Empire, and\\r\\nLeipsic (that battle of giants, where 110,000 soldiers were killed and\\r\\nwounded) made final success hopeless. In 1814 his brothers Lucien and\\r\\nLouis rallied to him, and Hortense was for the only time proud of her\\r\\nhusband. She thinks if he had shown less suspicion and she less pride\\r\\nthey might have been happy after all. \"My husband is a good Frenchman\\r\\n... he is an honest man.\" Meanwhile, Talleyrand is watching to guide\\r\\nthe _coup de grace_. Napoleon makes a dash for Lorraine to gather his\\r\\ngarrisons and cut off the enemy\\'s supplies. The Allies hesitate and\\r\\nare about to follow him, as per the rules of war. Talleyrand, the only\\r\\nman who could ever divine Napoleon, sends them the message, \"You can\\r\\ndo everything, and you dare nothing; dare therefore _once_!\" Hortense\\r\\nis the only _man_ left in Paris, and in vain she tries to keep Marie\\r\\nLouise, whose presence would have stimulated the Parisians to hold the\\r\\nAllies at bay. It is in vain. Unlike Prussia or Austria who fought\\r\\nfor months, or Spain who fought for years, after their capitals were\\r\\ntaken:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Like Nineveh, Carthage, Babylon and Rome,\\r\\n  France yields to the conqueror, vanquished at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Marmont\\'s betrayal Napoleon attempts suicide, and when he\\r\\nbelieves death imminent sends a last message to Josephine by\\r\\nCaulaincourt, \"You will tell Josephine that my thoughts were of her\\r\\nbefore life departed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on Monday, May 23rd, that Josephine\\'s illness commenced, after\\r\\nreceiving at dinner the King of Prussia and his sons (one afterwards\\r\\nWilhelm der Greise, first Emperor of Germany). Whether the sore throat\\r\\nwhich killed her was a quinsy or diphtheria[93] is difficult to prove,\\r\\nbut the latter seems the more probable. Corvisart, who was himself ill\\r\\nand unable to attend, told Napoleon that she died of grief and worry.\\r\\nBefore leaving for the Waterloo campaign Napoleon visited Malmaison,\\r\\nand there, as Lord Rosebery reminds us, allowed his only oblique\\r\\nreproach to Marie Louise to escape him: \"Poor Josephine. Her death, of\\r\\nwhich the news took me by surprise at Elba, was one of the most acute\\r\\ngriefs of that fatal year, 1814. She had her failings, of course; _but\\r\\nshe, at any rate, would never have abandoned me_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [92] Mlle. d\\'Avrillon says that during the Swiss voyage Josephine\\r\\n       found it desirable, for the first time, to \"wear whalebone in\\r\\n       her corsets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  [93] The same question may be asked respecting the death of\\r\\n       Montaigne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDIX (1)\\r\\n\\r\\nA REPUTED POEM BY NAPOLEON I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLE CHIEN, LE LAPIN, ET LE CHASSEUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nFABLE.--_Composee a l\\'age de 13 ans, par_ NAPOLEON I.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Cesar, chien d\\'arret renomme,\\r\\n      Mais trop enfle de son merite,\\r\\n      Tennait arrete dans son gite\\r\\n  Un malheureux lapin de peur inanime.\\r\\n  \"Rends-toi!\" lui cria-t-il, d\\'une voix de tonerre\\r\\n  Qui fit au loin trembler les peuplades des bois.\\r\\n  \"Je suis Cesar, connu par ses exploits,\\r\\n  Et dont le nom remplit toute la terre.\"\\r\\n      A ce grand nom, Jeannot Lapin,\\r\\n  Recommandant a Dieu son ame penitente,\\r\\n      Demande d\\'une voix tremblante:\\r\\n      \"Tres-serenissime matin,\\r\\n  Si je me rends quel sera mon destin?\"\\r\\n  \"Tu mourras.\" \"Je mourrai!\" dit la bete innocente.\\r\\n  \"Et si je fuis?\" \"Ton trepas est certain.\"\\r\\n  \"Quoi!\" reprit l\\'animal qui se nourrit de thym,\\r\\n  \"Des deux cotes je dois perdre la vie!\\r\\n      Que votre auguste seigneurie\\r\\n  Veuille me pardonner, puisqu\\'il me faut mourir,\\r\\n      Si j\\'ose tenter de m\\'enfuir.\"\\r\\n  Il dit, et fuit en heros de garenne.\\r\\n  Caton l\\'aurait blame; je dis qu\\'il n\\'eut pas tort.\\r\\n      Car le chasseur le voit a peine\\r\\n  Qu\\'il l\\'ajuste, le tire--et le chien tombe mort\\r\\n  Que dirait de ceci notre bon La Fontaine?\\r\\n      Aide-toi, le ciel t\\'aidera.\\r\\n      I\\'approuve fort cette methode-la.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDIX (2)\\r\\n\\r\\nGENEALOGY OF THE BONAPARTE FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany more or less fictitious genealogies of the Bonapartes have been\\r\\npublished, some going back to mythical times.

From him in\\r\\ndirect line was descended Francois de Sarzana, who was sent to Corsica\\r\\nin 1509 to fight for the Republic of Genoa.

TAKEN FROM THE MEMOIRS\\r\\n  OF MADAME DUCREST.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author asked the advice of Monsieur Frederic Masson about\\r\\nthese Letters, to which he at once received the courteous reply, \"Il\\r\\nfaut absolument rejeter les Lettres publiees par Regnault Varin[94] et\\r\\nreproduites par Georgette Ducrest; pas une n\\'est authentique.\" No one\\r\\nwho has read much of Napoleon\\'s correspondence can in fact believe for\\r\\na moment in their authenticity. They are interesting, however, as\\r\\nshowing the sort of stuff which went to form our grandfathers\\'\\r\\nfallacies about the relations of Napoleon and Josephine. Madame\\r\\nDucrest occasionally played and sang for Josephine after the\\r\\ndivorce. Her father was a nephew of Madame de Genlis. Madame\\r\\nDucrest married a musical composer, M. Bochsa, the then celebrated\\r\\nauthor of _Dansomanie_ and _Noces de Gamache_. He afterwards\\r\\ndeserted her, and her voice having completely failed, she was\\r\\ncompelled to write her Memoirs to earn sustenance thereby. Of these\\r\\nMemoirs M. Masson has said,[95] that \"in the midst of apocryphal\\r\\ndocuments, uncontroverted anecdotes, impossible situations, are yet\\r\\nto be found some first-hand personal observations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 1.--1796.\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM GENERAL BONAPARTE TO HIS WIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first laurel, my love, must be for my country; my second shall be\\r\\nfor you. While beating Alvinzi I thought of France; when I had\\r\\ndefeated him I thought of you. Your son will present to you a standard\\r\\nwhich he received from Colonel Morbach, whom he made prisoner with his\\r\\nown hands. Our Eugene, you see, is worthy of his father; and I trust\\r\\nyou do not think me an unworthy successor of the great and unfortunate\\r\\ngeneral, under whom 1 should have been proud to learn to conquer. I\\r\\nembrace you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 2.--1804.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO GENERAL BONAPARTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read over your letter, my dear, perhaps for the tenth time, and\\r\\nI must confess that the astonishment it caused me has given way only\\r\\nto feelings of regret and alarm. You wish to raise up the throne of\\r\\nFrance, and that, not for the purpose of seating upon it those whom\\r\\nthe Revolution overthrew, but to place yourself upon it. You say, how\\r\\nenterprising, how grand and, above all, useful is this design; but I\\r\\nshould say, how many obstacles oppose its execution, what sacrifices\\r\\nwill its accomplishment demand, and when realised, how incalculable\\r\\nwill be its results? But let us suppose that your object were already\\r\\nattained, would you stop at the foundation of the new empire? That new\\r\\ncreation, being opposed by neighbouring states, would stir up war with\\r\\nthem and perhaps entail their ruin. Their neighbours, in their turn,\\r\\nwill not behold it without alarm or without endeavouring to gratify\\r\\ntheir revenge by checking it. And at home, how much envy and\\r\\ndissatisfaction will arise; how many plots must be put down, how many\\r\\nconspiracies punished! Kings will despise you as an upstart, subjects\\r\\nwill hate you as an usurper, and your equals will denounce you as a\\r\\ntyrant. None will understand the necessity of your elevation; all will\\r\\nattribute it to ambition or pride. You will not want for slaves to\\r\\ncrouch beneath your authority until, seconded by some more formidable\\r\\npower, they rise up to oppose you; happy will it be if poison or the\\r\\npoignard!... But how can a wife, a friend dwell on these dreadful\\r\\nanticipations!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brings my thoughts back to myself, about whom I should care but\\r\\nlittle were my personal interests alone concerned. But will not the\\r\\nthrone inspire you with the wish to contract new alliances? Will you\\r\\nnot seek to support your power by new family connections? Alas!\\r\\nwhatever those connections may be, will they compensate for those\\r\\nwhich were first knit by corresponding fitness, and which affection\\r\\npromised to perpetuate? My thoughts linger on the picture which\\r\\nfear--may I say love, traces in the future. Your ambitious project has\\r\\nexcited my alarm; console me by the assurance of your moderation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 3.--_December 1809._\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE EMPEROR.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy forebodings are realised! You have just pronounced the word which\\r\\nseparates us for ever; the rest is nothing more than mere formality.\\r\\nSuch, then, is the result, I shall not say of so many sacrifices (they\\r\\nwere light to me, since they had you for their object), but of an\\r\\nunbounded friendship on my part and of the most solemn oaths on yours!\\r\\nIt would be a consolation for me if the state which you allege as your\\r\\nmotive were to repay my sacrifice by justifying your conduct! But that\\r\\npublic consideration which you urge as the ground for deserting me is\\r\\na mere pretence on your part. Your mistaken ambition has ever been,\\r\\nand will continue to be, the guide of all your actions, a guide which\\r\\nhas led you to conquests and to the assumption of a crown, and is now\\r\\ndriving you on to disasters and to the brink of a precipice.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou speak of the necessity of contracting an alliance, of giving an\\r\\nheir to your empire, of founding a dynasty! But with whom are you\\r\\nabout to form an alliance? with the natural enemy of France, that\\r\\nartful house of Austria, whose detestation of our country has its rise\\r\\nin its innate feelings, in its system, in the laws of necessity. Do\\r\\nyou believe that this hatred, of which she has given us such abundant\\r\\nproof, more particularly for the last fifty years, has not been\\r\\ntransferred by her from the kingdom of France to the French empire?\\r\\nThat the children of Maria Theresa, that skilful sovereign, who\\r\\npurchased from Madame de Pompadour the fatal treaty of 1756, which you\\r\\nnever mention without shuddering; do you imagine, I repeat, that her\\r\\nposterity, when inheriting her power, has not also inherited her\\r\\nspirit? I am merely repeating what you have so often said to me; but\\r\\nat that time your ambition was satisfied with humbling a power which\\r\\nyou now find it convenient to restore to its former rank. Believe me,\\r\\nas long as you shall exercise a sway over Europe, that power will be\\r\\nsubmissive to you; but beware of reverses of fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the necessity of an heir, I must speak out, at the risk of\\r\\nappearing in the character of a mother prejudiced in favour of her\\r\\nson; ought I, in fact, to be silent when I consider the interests of\\r\\none who is my only delight, and upon whom alone you had built all your\\r\\nhopes? That adoption of the 12th of January 1806 was then another\\r\\npolitical falsehood! Nevertheless the talents, the virtues of my\\r\\nEugene are no illusion. How often have you not spoken in his praise? I\\r\\nmay say more; you thought it right to reward him by the gift of a\\r\\nthrone, and have repeatedly said that he was deserving of greater\\r\\nfavours. Well, then! France has frequently re-echoed these praises;\\r\\nbut you are now indifferent to the wishes of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say nothing to you at present of the person who is destined to\\r\\nsucceed me, and you do not expect that I should make any allusion to\\r\\nthis subject. You might suspect the feelings which dictated my\\r\\nlanguage; nevertheless, you can never doubt of the sincerity of my\\r\\nwishes for your happiness; may it at least afford me some consolation\\r\\nfor my sufferings. Great indeed will be that happiness if it should\\r\\never bear any proportion to them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nPART OF A LETTER SAID TO BE DATED BRIENNE, 1814.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"... On revisiting this spot, where I passed my youthful days, and\\r\\ncontrasting the peaceful condition I then enjoyed with the state of\\r\\nterror and agitation to which my mind is now a prey, often have I\\r\\naddressed myself in these words: \\'I have sought death in numberless\\r\\nengagements; I can no longer dread its approach; I should now hail it\\r\\nas a boon ... nevertheless, I could still wish to see Josephine once\\r\\nmore!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE, AT MALMAISON.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Fontainebleau, 16th April 1814_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_My dear Josephine_,--I wrote to you on the 8th instant (it was on a\\r\\nFriday). You have perhaps not received my letter; fighting was still\\r\\ngoing on; it is possible that it may have been stopped on its way. The\\r\\ncommunications must now be re-established. My determination is taken;\\r\\nI have no doubt of this note coming to your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not repeat what I have already told you. I then complained of my\\r\\nsituation; I now rejoice at it. My mind and attention are relieved\\r\\nfrom an enormous weight; my downfall is great, but it is at least said\\r\\nto be productive of good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my retreat I intend to substitute the pen for the sword. The\\r\\nhistory of my reign will gratify the cravings of curiosity. Hitherto,\\r\\nI have only been seen in profile; I will now show myself in full to\\r\\nthe world. What facts have I not to disclose! how many men are\\r\\nincorrectly estimated! I have heaped favours upon a countless number\\r\\nof wretches; what have they latterly done for me?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have all betrayed me, one and all, save and except the excellent\\r\\nEugene, so worthy of you and of me. May he ever enjoy happiness under\\r\\na sovereign fully competent to appreciate the feelings of nature and\\r\\nof honour!\\r\\n\\r\\nAdieu, my dear Josephine; follow my example and be resigned. Never\\r\\ndismiss from your recollection one who has never forgotten, and never\\r\\nwill forget you! Farewell, Josephine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  NAPOLEON.\\r\\n\\r\\n_P.S._--I expect to hear from you when I shall have reached the island\\r\\nof Elba. I am far from being in good health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n  [94] _Memoires et Correspondance de l\\'Imperatrice Josephine_, par _J.\\r\\n       B. J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
